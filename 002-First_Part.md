#Part One: The Starting Point {.unnumbered}

Why a "new" order? Under the general context of his Personalist ideology, there lies a concrete vision of the world in which Arizmendiarrieta lived, a world that was dying before his eyes. Considering the eminently theoretical and dogmatic training he came out of, he showed an open sensitivity towards altering the focus of his entire reflection very soon. Early on, he began to perceive a sterile distance between the theories with which he'd been equipped and the social reality in place.

He had experienced the Spanish civil war up close; he was interested in getting to know the bloody realities of Europe from 1939 to 1945; he lived each day with the working population in the painful and needful postwar period. He believed that his philosophical-religious convictions were valid; but, at the same time, he understood that the long-suffering society he belonged to had the right to theoretical formulations more closely linked to their harsh reality, and more emancipatory in practice.

The general crisis he was living in would give Arizmendiarrieta the hope of a new order. For that, he would observe, there would need to be a debate around the minimum basis for that project: his religious and sociological vision of the crisis would serve to discover, precisely, the weakness of the existing bases and the urgency of developing, theoretically and practically, a communal and cooperative reform project.

With a highly astute intuition, but as yet without a system of thought that was transmissible to the people around him, Arizmendiarrieta would walk the edge of the crisis, at times with disconcerting affirmations, but always with his gaze wholeheartedly illuminated by his will to make the world, one day, fairer and freer.
