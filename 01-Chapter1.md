# A World in Crisis

This chapter attempts to offer an analysis of the social setting in which Arizmendiarrieta started out on his search for a "new order." *Social setting* here has a double meaning: it means, in the first place, the medium in which a person develops (family, town, social class, church, State), but it also means those fields or values Arizmendiarrieta referred to preferentially in developing his concept of the cooperative man.

We present, therefore, the general premises from which Arizmendiarrieta's reflection started. As will be seen, in and of themselves, they offer no originality at all; in large measure, they are no more than the typical, topical views of a young priest in the 1940s, who had just left the Vitoria Seminary, imbued with Personalist doctrines, but above all with traditional Catholic theology. There is a point to highlight. In contrast to the triumphalist and triumphant Catholicism at that time in Franco's Spain, Arizmendiarrieta felt engulfed by the worst religious, social, and cultural crisis ever faced by not just Euskadi [*the Basque country*], but the world. It is a tragic awareness of the crisis, caused, according to those who were closest to him, by his experience in the war. It is this heightened sense of the crisis, the awareness of its breadth, that enables us to understand the path of his thought.

The nature of Arizmendiarrieta's writings that we have requires an important prior clarification. The topics set forth below were not dealt with in a unified way by Arizmendiarrieta, but rather in a variety of times and contexts. So, for example, almost all the materials about the Church and a large part of those about the family were found in sermon notes; they belong, in addition, to the early '40s, which is to say, the first years of his priestly activities. On the other hand, a good part of the material about the State supposes a vigorous cooperative movement: the medium into which he pours out his opinions is no longer the pulpit, but the social conference room.

As a result, the writing method followed in this chapter is formally systematic. In a way, it tries to be a rigorous "system of Arizmendiarrieta's thought," which the very nature of the writings, as indicated above, does not allow to be satisfactorily reconstructed. The reader will easily see that it is simply impossible to try to align or structure a coherent and homogeneous model of opinions from such diverse times and contexts. No systematic analysis of the crisis exists in Arizmendiarrieta's writings. All that being said, we hope to be able to offer a clarifying panorama of the broader picture.

We divide this chapter into two parts (A and B). Arizmendiarrieta always referred to the general crisis indirectly, that is, always framing the various topics he dealt with (family, State, labor movement, etc.) within it. However, in his writings, two very different ways of referring to it can be distinguished:

A) In the first writings (sermons, conferences with parents, conferences with the youth of Catholic Action), the crisis is conceived of fundamentally as a crisis of faith, although faith is understood in a broad sense as a general system of Christian-humanist values.

B) Over the years 1945 to 1950, Arizmendiarrieta centers his attention on the so-called social question. The idea of a universal crisis (of authority, of faith, of reason itself) remains in place. But its core is no longer the problem of faith, but rather the question of property. As of this time, purely religious matters disappear almost entirely from Arizmendiarrieta's writings. Quotes from traditional Christian authors, especially from Papal Encyclicals, decrease notably, even as there is an increase in quotes from personalities outside the Church, and above all, from laborist politicians, until he arrived at his own conception of cooperatives, in the '50s.


## Part A: Religious view of the crisis {.unnumbered}

This is how Arizmendiarrieta sees his surroundings: in a total crisis of ideas, of principles, of authority, of coexistence, with the Second World War being the most conspicuous expression of this crisis. In his first writings, Arizmendiarrieta refers to this crisis on many occasions, always in the darkest tones, always emphasizing that its roots were of a moral nature (SS, I, 1, 3, 4, etc.).

## Early historical notes

### From soldier to priest

There is a radical breakpoint between Arizmendiarrieta the student or soldier and Arizmendiarrieta the priest after the war.

Arizmendiarrieta lived his early Biscay youth in pre-war nationalist euphoria, the Basque Renaissance—*Pizkundia*—actively participating in it in his own way, socially and linguistically/culturally. Politics does not appear to have ever interested him.

It is known that he participated in the Academia Kardaberaz, with professors Barandiarán and Lekuona,[^ch1-1] where he was one of the most enthusiastic collaborators, eventually becoming the secretary of the Academy. Handwritten notes and notebooks preserved in the Arizmendiarrieta Archive can give us an idea of his tireless activity and of the breadth of his literary interests: in those years, Arizmendiarrieta applied his pen equally to theater, poetry, translation, scientific and philosophical study, literary criticism, a personal diary, short stories, and the collection of ethnographic materials in the region of Markina/Ondárroa (songs, sayings, stories). When the war broke out, the 21-year-old joined the Basque Army (Euzko Gudarostea), lending his services as a journalist in the war newspaper *Eguna*,[^ch1-2] written entirely in Euskara [*Basque*].

[^ch1-1]: Larrañaga, J.: *Don Jose María Arizmendi-Arrieta y la experiencia cooperativa de Mondragón*, Caja Laboral Popular, Mondragón, 1981, 26-27.

[^ch1-2]: According to a Certificate from the Department of War (Euzkadi Government), Unit Formation Section of the E.B.B., issued in Bilbao on 22 December, 1936, Arizmendiarrieta was, at that time, inscribed "in the militias of this P.N.V. [*Basque Nationalist Party*] as a volunteer soldier with the number 10,486 as of the 22nd" (date of issue of the certificate). A new certificate, issued by the General Command General of the Militias of the P.N.V. the third of June, 1937, and which is also kept in the Arizmendiarrieta Archive, finds him inscribed in the militias of the P.N.V. as a volunteer with the number 76,120, and embedded in the Sukarrieta Battalion in expectation of service. Finally, his Military Card, issued in Bilbao on 15 June, 1937, has him embedded in the "Indus. Movili. Press Battalion," fixing his residency in the Abando Barracks. It bears a seal reading "*Eguna, egunoroko JEL-izparringija, Bilbao*" and one from the Department of Defense of the Euzkadi Government.

Numerous notes and newspaper clippings, which are still archived, bear witness to his interest in social topics. The topic of cooperation is already present among them, as is the idea of a third way between liberalism and collectivism, or the idea of a genuine Basque socialism. [*Translator's note: "liberalism" in this book does not refer to progressivism, but classical liberalism, which is to say, rationalism and unfettered capitalism.*] Cultural and social concerns harmonized perfectly, following Aitzol's line: we could speak of a nationalism of *risorgimento*, with strong social and cultural content, animated by an irresistible mystique. The war, which truncated the Basque Renaissance, was also a hard personal blow for Arizmendiarrieta.

Following the defeat, prison, and acquittal in a summary trial, Arizmendiarrieta was destined for the offices of the Burgos Artillery barracks. "Mobilized from 1936-1939, served in Bilbao and Burgos on both sides," he himself would write on his curriculum vitae.[^ch1-3]

In Burgos, with the help of a Seminary professor, he studied theology on his own, was examined in Bergara, where the Seminary of the Diocese of Vitoria was operating provisionally. "Returned to Seminary late 1939 and ordained priest December 1940, was sent to the Mondragon Parish in January 1941, where I remain," he would write on the above-mentioned CV.

It is hardly necessary to stop and describe the post-war cultural climate. "The defeat of the republican government," says J.C. Tabares in summary, "led to the flight of 90% of the Spanish ‘*intelligenzia*.’ Two thousand [*primary-school*] teachers, 200 secondary-school teachers, and 118 university professors went into exile."[^ch1-4] This cultural desertion was even harder on Euskadi, where the Basque language itself was banned, and those who had previously cultivated it were persecuted. It would be many years before Arizmendiarrieta would again write anything in Euskara [*the Basque language*], even private notes.

Euskadi had been culturally and politically decapitated. More concretely, the Basque Church saw its Bishop, Mateo Múgica, exiled, and priests subjected to a blind persecution "in the course of which sixteen priests would be shot, more than two hundred jailed, and the rest, a total of eight hundred, were taken to concentration camps, deported, or escaped into exile."[^ch1-5] Among the priests executed by Franco's troops was Aitzol, the soul of the cultural Renaissance and of nationalist social propaganda. The Biscay poet Lauaxeta was also shot dead in Vitoria. The Arizmendiarrieta Archive holds testimonies of the attraction this poet held for José María as a student.

### The Apostolic administrator

José María Arizmendiarrieta was ordained as a priest the twenty-first of December, 1940, by Francisco Javier Lauzurica y Torralba, Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Vitoria since September of 1937. After the forced exile of Mons. Múgica, he would also be the one who prevented him from studying sociology in Belgium, sent him to Mondragon, and watched over his early activities. Even though literature on this prelate is relatively abundant, we ask the reader's leave to stop and spend a moment on him, to make Arizmendiarrieta's early period of activities in Mondragon more understandable.

"The war," Manu E. Lipúzcoa tells us, "found Mons. Lauzurica among his people (in Durango) and, like the rest of the Church leaders, he had not suffered at all from the extremely violent situation imposed by the conflict. On several occasions, he demonstrated his satisfaction with the work of the authorities of the Euzkadi government, which was made up almost entirely of Catholics. This was what gave him a well-founded confidence that his wish to be transferred to France would be fulfilled. That did indeed happen, and the Basque government provided him with everything for his plan. But once he was on French soil, the first statement he made was in contradiction to his previous positions. Back in Spain, he began to show so much support for the cause of Franco's Spain, that, according to apostolic delegate Mons. Antoniutti, he thought about preparing things so he could take the reins of the orphaned Diocese of Vitoria."[^ch1-6]

The Falange delegate in Guipuzcoa publicly affirmed (in honor of Mons. Lauzurica) that he had heard Franco give the following opinion: "I have a bishop for Vitoria. He is a man who will speak of God by speaking of Spain."[^ch1-7] For his part, he [Lauzurica] seems to have been very clear on his apostolic mission in the Basque land: "I am one more general at the orders of the *Generalísimo* to crush nationalism."[^ch1-8] [*Translator's note: in the Basque Country, both sides in the Spanish Civil War were called "nationalist," in reference to different "nations"—Spain or the Basque Country.*]

And, indeed, his theology corresponded with this mission: "When I say Spain, I say Church," he affirmed in Bilbao. "To love Spain is to love the greatest, the most sublime. To scorn it is to scorn what is most sacred (...). Scholars, love Spain and you will love God, and Spain will give you happiness on Earth, and Our Lord will give you glory in the kingdom of heaven."[^ch1-9]

I. d’Errotalde. *Les preoccupations de Monseigneur Lauzurika*, *Euzko Deya* (Paris), Nr. 81, 7 nov. 1937, 2 (Ed. Vascas, San Sebastián 1979, vol. I, 344).

Mons. Lauzurica was convinced that without the military insurrection, "we were, by that date, on the eve of seeing all of Spain become a Russian canton under the tyrannical power of the Godless." "Providence sent us a man who united military talent with a deeply Christian spirit, who was heroically patriotic and serenely righteous. [...] All men of good will should join him who have proper respect for religion, love for the homeland, and a concern for seeing the nation supported by a framework of justice that lifts citizens up."[^ch1-10]

Lauzurica, while demanding from his priests a "fervent cultivation of the Castillian language, which is, at the same time, required of us by our unbreakable love for Spain and our thankfulness to this wonderful language of the Spanish culture, through which our mystics and ascetics poured out their sublime concepts," was inclined to allow preaching in Euskara "when the faithful, by an overwhelming majority, is unaccustomed to utilizing a language other than Basque." An immediate intervention by the Minister of Public Order Martínez Anido nipped that in the bud. Euskara was expressly prohibited "in prayers and preaching, and in every kind of public act of any character or nature."[^ch1-11]

### 1940-1945: The restoration

All of Spain, especially Red Spain, had to be purified: the new governors devoted themselves diligently from the first moment to cleansing the country of "corrosive ideas" which, it was said, had been the cause of Spain's ruin. It was necessary to restore Spanish imperial unity, based on spiritual and religious unity. For such purposes, the new State found its most powerful ally in the Church.[^ch1-12]

Mons. Lauzurica, Apostolic Administrator for the three Basque provinces, knew just how to distinguish the white sheep from the black in his flock:

> We want to make it known here, for the pride of Navarre and Alava, that these two sister provinces were able to maintain the heights of their glorious and irrefutable tradition: in contrast, a large part of the honorable citizens of Biscay and Guipuzcoa forced the ouster of several leaders who were unable to appreciate the fair value of the treasure of spirituality which was placed in their hands. Later, they attempted to justify their conduct by equating the crimes of Red Spain with the executions of national Spain. What an inexplicable aberration! In Red Spain, the priest was persecuted as a minister of God; in national Spain, he was always respected in his role of minister of the Catholic religion. In Red Spain, the temples of the Lord were destroyed, torn apart, or closed down, destined for profane, if not sacrilegious, uses; in national Spain, they continued to be used for worship, and as our weapons brought towns into the New Spain, the buildings regained their old designations, and, consecrated anew to the Lord, they were opened for worship. In Red Spain, hatred for religion was systematic; in national Spain, the Catholic faith was and is lived deeply, and outdoes itself showing love for God.[^ch1-13]

It was very true that it outdid itself showing love for God, to the point where some analysts would see in it an essential characteristic of early Francoism. Solemn processions, pallia, Eucharistic Congresses, popular missions, consecrations to the Sacred Heart or the Virgin, restorations of brotherhoods, imagery and shrines, were the order of the day. The presence of "authorities and hierarchies" in religious acts seems to have been obligatory. As F. Urbina writes about that period, its fundamental character is "a search for the total restoration of traditional religious forms."[^ch1-14] Obviously, it was a unitary political-religious project--a total order, which, as A.L. Orensanz observed, was about opposing modernity, and which encompasses the entire social structure with a sacred significance.[^ch1-15]

It does not fall to us to retell the history of that time. However, so that the current reader will be able to get an idea of the general climate in which Arizmendiarrieta began his pastoral activity, we will take the liberty of again providing some informative strokes of the pen that such acts merited at the time in the magazine *Ecclesia*,[^ch1-16] according to the above-mentioned study by F. Urbina.[^ch1-17]

>a) Large popular missions
>
>* (March of 1941, Barcelona) "500 missionaries, for almost the whole month of March, have carried the truths of the faith into the very heart of the city... This was much needed by the lovely regional capital, Barcelona, so beset by corrosive doctrines." [In the final act of this mission,] "the venerable Christ of Lepanto came out of the Cathedral, accompanied by authorities and hierarchies of the Movement and an immense crowd."[^ch1-18]
>
>* (March of 1941, Seville) "His Eminence gave final instructions to 200 missionaries and 500 laypeople of the four branches of C.A. charged with helping them... Attendance at the closing meeting was some 50,000 people. In adulterous relationships alone, more than 30,000 have been corrected, and there is not prisoner in jail with whom we have not communicated."[^ch1-19]
>
>b) Spiritual Exercises
>
>* (April 1941) "Throughout Spain, spiritual exercises dedicated to youth have been held. According to data, even rather incomplete, the number of participants in them was nearly 100,000."[^ch1-20]
>
>* (May 1941, First Congress of Spiritual Exercises, Barcelona). "In the presidency of the Congress was Cardinal Segura, the chief of the fourth military Region, general Orgaz, the bishops of Barcelona, Calahorra and Tortosa, the Civil Governor, Correa Veglison; the Minister of Justice, among others, closed the act..."[^ch1-21]
>
>* (Biscay, 1945). "2,000 Babcock Wilcox workers do spiritual exercises in the very naves of the factories."[^ch1-22]
>
>c) Traditional devotions
>
>* "The brotherhood of laborers, over which the Marquis de Purchena presides, proposes to bring about its resurgence, with all its traditional attire."[^ch1-23]
>
>* "The First Congress of Brotherhoods is celebrated in Seville, in which 1,880 associations came together from the 4 provinces of eastern Andalucia, representing a total of 180,000 men and 250,000 women."[^ch1-24]
>
>d) Redress
>
>* "In Madrid, the procession of the Patroness of City Hall is reestablished after 73 years."[^ch1-25]
>
>* "In Zaragoza, a relic of Saint José de Calasanz, which was providentially saved from destruction by the Marxists, was exposed to the veneration of the faithful."[^ch1-26]
>
>* "The Virgin of Macarena has returned to her home, which the Marxist hordes had once destroyed."[^ch1-27]
>
>e) Pilgrimages
>
>* "6,000 pilgrims of the youth of Catholic Action in the consecration of the holy chamber of Oviedo, with the presence of Chief of State, Nuncio, Generals Aranda, Roca y Valdés, Cabanillas; Archbishop of Santiago, Bishops from Lugo, Mondoñedo and Coria."[^ch1-28]
>
>* June, 1945. Military pilgrimage to the Hill of the Angels with the participation of 50 generals and 1,500 leaders and officials; in attendance at the Mass were the Undersecretary of the Presidency, Carrero Blanco; the ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; generals Orgaz, Muñoz Grandes, Moscardó y Kindelán, etc.[^ch1-29]

As Manu E. Lipúzcoa observed, this era was characterized by religious inflation, on the one hand, which attempted to absorb all of life, both public and private, and by the traditionalism of the triumphant faith, on the other, taken to the most absurd limits: it was the time of the rise of the prophecies of Mother Rafols and Father Hoyos, of "I will reign in Spain" inscribed on innumerable homes and enthroned in public places, of Santiago Matamoros [*Saint James the Moor-Killer*] and of the Virgen del Pilar Capitana. A preacher could effectively compete to show his Catholic and patriotic feelings, going so far as to print expressions such as: "The Virgin, had she not been Jewish, would have been Spanish."[^ch1-30]

### The curate

This was, with the few local variants possible under a regime that tried hard to make everything uniform, the political-religious environment in which Arizmendiarrieta's work began.

This Basque cleric was able, to a certain extent, to stay on the margins of this official ideological pressure, despite the efforts of his prelate. The prestigious Seminary of Vitoria played a decisive role in this.[^ch1-31] But that does not mean that on numerous occasions he did not have to bend.

Some covert forms of opposition seem surprising today: thus, according to S. Mitxelena, the years of organizing pilgrimages to Lourdes, instead of to Fátima or Zaragoza, as well as the consecrations to the Virgin of Aránzazu (Arizmendiarrieta consecrated the Youth of Mondragon to her), rather than to the Sacred Heart, would have had a clear content of opposition and resistance which, if understood as such by the authorities, would have entailed ongoing risk.[^ch1-32] Certainly the absence, in this sense, of official "devotions" in Arizmendiarrieta is symptomatic and more than noteworthy. But nor would it do to overestimate it. On the one hand, the integration of priests into the controlled ecclesiastical machinery seems to have been very tight in those years, so that can hardly imagine a priest, much less a young curate, acting on his own, outside official directives, which were prepared to regulate everything, down to the last detail. And, on the other hand, the union of the Church and of the State had become—at the hierarchical level—so intimate that many of the religious activities were draped with an undisputed political nature, and there were even some priests who accepted local political positions by episcopal appointment.[^ch1-33]

[^ch1-33]: This is how Arizmendiarrieta, on the proposal of the Provincial Delegate of the Youth of Guipuzcoa, was named by his Bishop as Delegate (sic) of the Youth Front of Mondragon (Office of the Bishopric of Victoria, 8 July of 1944, Arizmendiarrieta Archive). This appointment does not seem to have had any effect. Neither in his writings nor in the Archive have we been able to find, apart from the aforementioned appointment, any other data that make direct or indirect reference to any activity of Arizmendiarrieta's as Delegate of the Youth Front.

Arizmendiarrieta, from the beginning, seems to have had a relatively critical and distant stance, which cost him no end of run-ins, as we'll see later. But he never ceased striving to defend the Church in public. His attitude will change notably, starting in 1945, as he dedicates himself more fully to the social question. By way of illustration, we can deduce here his response, somewhere between skeptical and disillusioned, to the President of the Youth of Catholic Action, who requested his collaboration to organize a religious-patriotic pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.

> With great pleasure, and by immediate return mail, I shall answer your message, and I shall do so briefly.
>
> I believe that the youth still have a long way to go before reaching those spiritual heights of understanding the ascetic or mystical meaning of the pilgrimage, and as long as they do not have a pilgrim's preparation, it would be simple tourism. Wanting a good representation from Guipuzcoa to go on this pilgrimage could mean awakening people's curiosity to see new lands, but not precisely to continue the spiritual growth they have embarked upon. The material that you send could be accepted and made use of, but I fear it would barely move people, many would be set back, and others would be prevented from approaching us. I believe that with the above, the object of your request is fulfilled, and in any case, I am always at your disposal.[^ch1-34]

[^ch1-34]: Letter from Arizmendiarrieta to the President of la J.A.C., of 8 July 1947 (Arizmendiarrieta Archive).

But let us return to the period immediately after the war. Named curate of the Parish of St. John the Baptist of Mondragon, Arizmendiarrieta arrives in this villa on February 5th, 1941. He is assigned to work with the male youth of Catholic Action, which had been recently founded. Through Catholic Action and, later, through teaching, he remains in close contact with the working world: unemployment, lack of housing, tuberculosis, and children in miserable conditions, which will constitute his great personal concerns from the beginning. However, his official apostolic obligations are imposed on him by the position of Chaplain of C.A., which will not be officially assigned to him until 1943.[^ch1-35] By then, Arizmendiarrieta had already had his first brushes with Falangist representatives in Mondragon. But it should not be thought of as any kind of confrontational situation, in these years, between the ecclesiastical and civilian powers in Mondragon. As for Arizmendiarrieta, all witnesses agree that he proceeded with greatest caution, trying to avoiding conflicts by all means, especially those that could have any political nature.

His initial activity is focused, as has been said, on youth. He founds Youth Sports and the Professional School,[^ch1-36] organizes raffles, cavalcades, Christmas campaigns, collections in favor of the poorest children, collections for needy families, etc. From very early on, he takes charge of the Parish Work of Spiritual Exercises[^ch1-37]; publishes a small magazine, *Alleluia* (later "*Equis*," [*X*] and then "*Ecos*" [*Echoes*]), really more of a flier, which will also cost him some run-ins with censorship.[^ch1-38]

It can be said that by this time (1941-1945), Arizmendiarrieta has developed the classical pastoral work of a young curate, carrying out the functions and tasks he is assigned, from preaching (118 sermons are preserved) and the confessional to the organization of spiritual exercises or of a Eucharistic Congress.[^ch1-39] It is very true that the study circles that he has formed among the youth will soon bear fruit. But, for the moment, there is nothing that would make one think of the decisive social orientation that he will try to imprint upon the youth of Catholic Action in the late '40s. Later, he himself will describe this period as the time of sowing. But this sowing must have happened more by the spoken word than in writing. The notes that fill the files, the conferences, and the sermons, his concern for spiritual exercises and retreat days, for the honesty of the entertainment of youth,[^ch1-40] etc. remind us that we are in the middle of the restoration period. The reader should keep this in mind through the sections that follow, in which we will try to collect Arizmendiarrieta's thought in his early years, 1941-1945.

[^ch1-35]: The Association of Youth of Catholic Action was founded at Mondragon, on the initiative of *don* Roberto Aguirre, the 12th of May, 1940, and legally constituted as such June 10th of the same year. The 25th of February, 1941, *don* Roberto was replaced in the office of chaplain by Arizmendiarrieta (PR, I, 126). However the official appointment of "Chaplain of the Parish Centers of Men and Male Youth of Catholic Action, for the triennium 1943-1946" dates from the first of January, 1943 (Office of the Diocesan Delegate of C.A., Bishopric of Victoria, Arizmendiarrieta Archive).

[^ch1-36]: Youth Sports of Mondragon is created and officially presented to the public the first of June of 1943 (PR, I, 127), and the Professional School is inaugurated October first of the same year in the old building of the Foundación Viteri, cf. Leibar, J., "José María Arizmendiarrieta Madariaga. Notes for a Biography," *TU*, Nr. 190, Nov.-Dec. 1976, 60.

[^ch1-37]: This work had also been founded in Mondragon by *don* Roberto Aguirre in November-December of 1939, in the Unión Cerrajera. In 1941, other companies of the villa were associated, and organized themselves, under Arizmendiarreta's responsibility, into 26 batches of Exercises (for 305 male workers and 148 female workers). We have not been able to find data for the year 1942, when he seems to have had some difficulties. Then in 1943, only 12 batches are registered (PR, I, 50), which, in 1944, are back up to 27 (PR, I, 65).

[^ch1-38]: The decision to remove these "pages," that is, "something effective for the youth of Catholic Action" was made, according to the minutes, in the session of the Board of Directors on April 2, 1942 (PR, I, 43). The small magazine started with a circulation of 60 copies, reaching 160 two years later (PR, I, 54). The collections are preserved in the Arizmendiarrieta Archive.

[^ch1-39]: As of January 25, 1946, Arizmendiarrieta is named Delegate of the Archpriesthood of Mondragon for the preparation of the Provincial Eucharistic Congress of Guipuzcoa (Arizmendiarrieta Archive).

Let us see, then, in this first section (A), how the young priest, 25 years old, faces reality with no more intellectual preparation than his philosophy studies in seminary and those of theology (on his own) in the barracks, plus an intensive course of Ethical-Social studies. The Civil War has ended. The prisons are still full of prisoners.[^ch1-41] Europe burns in the Second World War.

## The crisis of liberal reason

"Today humanity is going through a crisis which has had perhaps no equal in history" (SS, II, 158). And this political, social, and religious crisis corresponds to the crisis of reason, which has attempted constitute itself as the guide and organizer of human life. This crisis of reason has become, then, a crisis of authority, of coexistence, of ideas themselves ("what idea remains standing, what idea is respected, what idea is saved in this chaos of confusion, what idea is there of God, with whose light mankind can be oriented and channeled?") (SS, II, 158). Rationalist liberalism, by recognizing the right to citizenship of all ideas, has practically destroyed the idea itself, with objective value, plunging humanity "in this ocean of skepticism in whose sky there is no star that can orient man on his course" (SS, II, 159).

The crisis humanity is going through is, therefore, a crisis of faith and, simultaneously, a crisis of reason, which is proclaimed to be self-sufficient. "My intelligence in me," says Arizmendiarrieta, "just like my heart, is an interested party, and cannot extract itself from the interests that animate my body or my heart. It cannot be an impartial judge, but rather is always an interested party" (PR, I, 124). That is why reason alone is unable to define the goals of human life, just as it cannot find the righteous path.

[^ch1-40]: On the entertainment of youth, see CAS, 117-130 and PR, I, 87-90. The cinema was a major concern, which is why Arizmendiarrieta developed an extensive film file, which, in 1944, already contained more than 5,000 cards. In the Arizmendiarrieta Archive, there is a record of several protests of his for some movies having been censored, in his opinion undeservedly, by the diocesan commission.

[^ch1-41]: According to calculations made by Tamames, R., *La República. La era de Franco*, Alliance, Madrid, 1975, 355, in 1941, the number of political prisoners in the jails of the Franco's State exceeded 170,000. Other researchers have given much higher statistics, cf. Fernandez Vargas, V., *La resistencia interior en la España de Franco*, Istmo, Madrid 1981, 61. In 1947, the Newsletter of the Basque Government still estimated the number of political prisoners at 102, 292. cf. Fernandez Vargas, V., op. cit., 63. "In synthesis," writes Tamames, "adding in the politically exiled population, we reach the conclusion that between 1939 and 1950, in those 12 years, a total of 875,000 man-years was lost. Which—to give a graphic idea—is equivalent to 875,000 prisoners for a whole year (around 8% of the active population of that time) or 74,672 men in prison for 12 consecutive years."

In Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, to believe is the law of life: "To live, it is necessary to believe; to live as it corresponds to him, man has to believe" (PR, I, 125). This principle will remain constant in his thought until his last writings, even though later, he will prefer to express it as need for ideals, for utopias.

By its nature, the insufficiency of reason does not so much mean a deficiency, to Arizmendiarrieta, as it does the possibility of unlimited development and a radical opening of human nature. Recalling Pascal, he tells us, "man cannot be defined as a rational animal, but as a rational and religious animal, which is called to the infinite" (SS, I, 139). Man cannot achieve the infinite by himself: he is a mysterious, inexplicable mix of grandeur and misery, of beast and angel. He must recognize his weakness. "The ultimate act of his reason is to know that it cannot know everything." But, from the moment reason comes to recognize its own limitation, unsuspected possibilities open up before it, and the path on which the truth is revealed to us opens up (SS, I,139).

The insufficiency of reason is not relative only to God; it is also relative to man himself, which is an aspect that deserves to be specially highlighted for the consequences it will have in Arizmendiarrieta's thinking. Man, by reason alone, is incapable, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, of discovering true human dignity. Man is, to man, an enigma, and "natural reason does not project radiant and immense enough light to be able to always dissipate those doubts and determine, by reason of the dignity and nobility recognized in him, an attitude of respect and consideration" (SS, I, 209). Arizmendiarrieta believes he can prove this assertion through an analysis of the various evaluations the most illustrious thinkers, especially the pre-Christians, have done throughout history.

The immediate consequence derived from this thesis is that a social order based on reason alone must remain well below what human dignity deserves. On the other hand, having tried to base them on reason alone is the cause, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, of the multitude of ideologies and social doctrines, not infrequently mutually opposed, and the subsequent disintegration of society. "The chaos and the confusion of ideas, of duties and rights, will not disappear until we look at things in the light of faith, which is the only way we are capable of discovering ourselves in our neighbor, beyond the appearances of poor or rich, friend or enemy, compatriot or foreigner, as a brother of ours, bestowed by God with inalienable rights, and always worthy of our respect and consideration." (SS, I, 218)

The Modern Era, which started by proclaiming the sufficiency and primacy of reason, precisely with the intended purpose of exalting man with his deserved dignity, is over, in Arizmendiarrieta's estimation, and he clearly proclaims the total failure of the attempt. In modern society, man is again considered as he was in ancient, pre-Christian societies: "Man, the supposed king of creation, is the most unfortunate being. Man disregards himself, does not know himself, does not know his dignity and is a toy, rather, is a wretch or any old thing that does not deserve or instill respect" (SS, I, 124-125). Arizmendiarrieta ironically comments: "There you have him with his lantern, with his reason alone!" (Ib. 125). Old liberal reason, humiliated now, is shown powerless to do work of restoration. "Today," he says, "after so many transformations and developments, we have come to a halt at state of things in which no human solution can be discerned, because in the world as it stands, there remains no element or resource that can be used." (Ib. 155) There no longer remains any principle, or any moral authority, on which to remake humanity in war. Authority has ceased to exist, has lost credibility, from the moment that the exercise of rights was entrusted to strength. Principles have lost value, because, from the moment that the freedom of ideas was declared, they have torn each other apart, and today, it is impossible for men to agree on any point. This relativism with respect to principles and ideas, translated into the lack of respect for ideas and principles, has turned mankind, emptied of ideals, into an animal that follows its instincts, unchecked and unrestrained. "In the name of what, in the name of whom, will order be brought, or justice established, if justice for some is a thirst for revenge, and for others, the annihilation of one's neighbor...?" (Ib.).

Arizmendiarrieta sees the world divided into democrats and totalitarians (collectivists), both being incapable, in his opinion, of finding a solution to the grave problem of class struggle. Democratic systems do not guarantee such a solution, because they rapidly degenerate into demagoguery. The totalitarian systems have been able to overcome class struggle, but not by giving a solution, but rather, on the basis of transforming it in struggle of collectivities (Ib.). Neither formula can be assured a true social peace. "There is no human remedy, there is no human power capable of creating a stable order of things, and it will all come down, as the steeple collapses when the walls fail, like the arch on which the support rests." (Ib.)

Peace and unity will only be possible when mankind finds a high ideal, a convergence point that shows itself to our wills. But this point itself must be outside the borders of this visible world, it cannot be man himself, because otherwise, man, carried away by selfishness, ultimately sets himself up as an end, trying to subjugate his peers. "In this world, which is decomposed, broken, in pieces; in this chaos, we can assert, on the one hand, that the unity that is needed, unity in which we must find peace and well-being, must not be brought about by reawakening in her the awareness of common blood and the pride of that blood, nor kindling the awareness of strength itself, which must degenerate necessarily into violence; that universal unity that is needed must not be made and accomplished around myths of homeland, empire, destiny, or blood, but rather, that unity must burst forth like pure spring water, must appear when our intelligence is informed by those dogmatic truths of supernatural brotherhood over and above natural diversity (...), intellectual illumination which must then be translated into the concordance of wills, which must converge on that point of common aspiration." (Ib. 156-157)

The most prominent critical allusions always refer to National Socialism. But, as can be seen, allusions to Falangist ideology, to nationalism in general and, perhaps, to Basque nationalism are not lacking.

The principles around which efforts have been made to unite communities (homeland, destiny, empire, race, blood) have failed, because, behind them, "in reality, is hidden nothing but ambition, the desire for dominance, and despotism." The crisis has become widespread: "today, there is no human resource in the world usable for social renewal, to unite wills and undertake the path of reconstruction." (SS, II, 159)

There remains no other way than that of the return to social principles and Christian dogmas. "That crisis of ideas will find no solution except in humanity's return to the principles of faith. Human reason, which is weak and sick, must find its cure in the return to religious dogma; it needs to believe, and when it does not believe in God, it believes in man, and it is seeing how it turns out to believe in man" (SS, II, 159-160).

Human reason, stripped of interests and selfishness, has no obstacles to humbly accepting the eternal truths; it is when interests intervene that it refuses to accept them, having to then resort to justifications of noble appearance (SS, I, 206), but that, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, have none of the impartiality and rationality they claim.

The triumph of selfishness, for its part, has a cause, which is the loss of faith, and the abandonment of God. Arizmendiarrieta seems, then, to move in a circle, with the loss of faith and the explosion of selfishness being mutual causes.

Arizmendiarrieta takes as his own Balmes' idea of historical periods of delirium, in one of which he believes he finds himself, even though he has not stopped to explain how such historical delusions arise. In these periods, fury blinds understanding and denatures hearts, and the most horrendous crimes are committed, always invoking august names ("man has such a strong and lively feeling of the excellence of virtue that even the greatest crimes try to disguise themselves with its cloak," in Arizmendiarrieta's expression). Societies, then, are like a man in the throes of delirium, and the ideas, the nature, and the conduct of the delirious man would be poorly judged by what he says and does while in that lamentable state. History shows numerous examples of such episodes. "In our own days, we have been witnesses to this state of delirium, which society has passed through, in which we ourselves have been perhaps more than simple spectators" (SS, I, 143).

This explosion of selfishness and delirium was prepared by liberalism, by proclaiming freedom as a supreme value, unlimited and unconditioned, which is equivalent to the proclamation of man for himself, the truth and the law being subordinate to him. If man places himself above the truth and the law, social authority "has no more function or mission than those of a traffic cop" (SS, II, 146). Man will be able to think as he likes, and work as well, so that the employer will oppose laws and contracts that stipulate working conditions, and the worker will not commit himself to anything. The result will be that "mankind lives for a few." (SS, I, 147)

Arizmendiarrieta does not lament "the disappearance of this kingdom, falsely called Christian, in which the combining of the truth with the lie is more hateful and repugnant than error, boldly professed and practiced." (SS, I, 155)

The century of freedom has been succeeded by the century of strength, of violence, the twentieth century: strength and violence, which are translated into the predominant political systems, and into the methods that all sides employ. The Church, formerly mocked for teaching that freedom has to be exercised within legality, is now belittled for condemning the way of violence (Ib. 148). As in the last century, it came to be conventional wisdom that the exercise of full freedom would lead to well-being, to peace and universal prosperity; today, it has become conventional wisdom that there is no other way to establish justice than with the edge of the sword.

The new dawn of mankind that was expected has already led to tragedy twice. A radical return of principles is required, and a search for new foundations.

This crisis of ideas, it has already been said, will find no solution except in humanity's return to the principles of faith. The crisis of unity can only be overcome by the Christian spirit of love and fraternity, based on the awareness of equality of souls and the destiny of all mankind. The crisis of authority, finally, can be overcome when its exercise does not amount to the imposition of personal ambitions, but rather service provided to people in the name of God. Constituted States will not be able to save us from the present crisis, as they themselves were created on principles that are corrosive—principles that lead, over the long term, to decomposition, to despotism, to war, to injustice. All these myths, Arizmendiarrieta repeats, of homeland, of race, empire, destiny, class, are corrosive (SS, I, 160): they will not be able to provide us with peace and well-being any more than an elm can give pears.

Only the Church, whose mission is to make a second golden age flourish on Earth, in which the difference of races and nations, classes and professions, no longer engenders haughtiness and disdain, envy and hatred, can provide the solution to this crisis and this delirium. Only the Church can be the basis of the new order, to which we are all called. (SS, I,161)

To explain the insufficiency of human reason, Arizmendiarrieta uses *Alleluia*, the magazine directed to youth (PR, I, 123), to tell a great adventure of Baron Munchausen: One day, he fell down a deep well, and, because he did not know how to swim and was unable to grab onto anything, needed to find a way to escape. In this desperate situation, he had the happy idea of saving himself by grabbing ahold of his own ears with his hands and giving a strong upwards pull.

"This escape, so extravagant and so implausible (...), is an escape that men in other areas of life admit as an acceptable and natural thing. There are many, philosophers and wise people, who think and teach that man, ever afloat on a sea of doubts and worries, and agitated by all kinds of passions, can be self-sufficient and successful, led through life with steady steps by invoking his reason and following the path that it shows him. Reason is his only guide, and the path laid out by it, his only path." (Ib.)

What is striking about the case is that the children would not believe the story of the Baron fallen in the water and rescued in such an original way, but many sensible people believe, without difficulty, the philosophers "who tell them that man is self-sufficient, and there is more than enough reason for everything." (Ib. 125)

## The Church, sign of contradiction

Arizmendiarrieta worked to defend the Church publicly, as well as he could, in the difficult postwar years. It is necessary to distinguish, however, the political level and the social. We will deal briefly with the political issue, leaving for another place the topic of the relationships of the two societies, the Church and the State (cf. 9, 1; 9, 2).

### The Church of the conquerors

A very widespread accusation at that time was of having made common cause with the conquerors. In Arizmendiarrieta's writings, not a single allusion is found to the role played by the Church in the war. We only find observations like one that is repeated, that the religion is not responsible for what is done in its name. Instead, allusions are frequently made to the fact that the Church, in public life, appears united to political power, and, as such, is the object of a great deal of criticism, which Arizmendiarrieta rejects.

"'What is the Church doing,' it is often asked, 'consenting to sometimes place its canopies in the hands of its most unworthy children? What is the Church doing, allowing those who have not loved their neighbors to approach the altar? What is it doing, surrounded by so many Pharisees and hypocrites?'" (Ib. 137) Arizmendiarrieta, remembering the conduct of Jesus with the public sinner, responds by asking: "What is Christ doing surrounded by so many sinners, so many publicans? What is he doing? But is not [*the Church*] the mother who must seek the conversion of the sinner?" It is not easy to imagine that Arizmendiarrieta could sincerely have considered as equal the situations that are equated here.

In fact, Arizmendiarrieta does not insist that the Church, with its conduct at the side of the powerful—undisputed sinners, it would seem—is following the example of its founder, the friend of sinners and publicans. It should be seen more as an argumentation of the historical type, even though its validity continues to be rather doubtful from many points of view.

The Church, he says, is intransigent and intolerant with error, "because it knows that it alone possesses the truth, and it alone is the teacher of the truth. This intransigence, this doctrinal intolerance of the Church, which watches over its teachings and the purity of its doctrine with such scrupulousness, is a commendation in its favor, it is a test that reflects well on it." (Ib. 139)

But also, God, who cannot bless evil, tolerates it; in the same way, the Church has always been tolerant with people, according to what he tells us (Ib. 141). Trying to relativize the same criticisms, he will add that, for a whole century, the nineteenth century (Arizmendiarrieta considers it the century of rationalism and liberalism), the Church was accused of not being sufficiently tolerant. Its intransigence and firmness scandalized the peoples of that century. Freedom was proclaimed as the supreme value, that needed to be respected and held to by the Church as well. The century has changed, and the way men think has changed, too: the spirit of struggle and violence dominates; "even the truth itself must be imposed." (Ib. 137-138; 147) Today, the Church is criticized for its tolerance, for its condescension with human weakness. It is required that it, too, act with a violent spirit, with that spirit of war and class struggle characteristic of our time, and which the Church has always detested. "Thus, the Church is always between two fires, as Christ was." (Ib. 145)

In May of 1946, Arizmendiarrieta tries to respond to the objections arising because of the Eucharistic Congress. First, to the objection that such celebrations are more political events than religious, he does not deny that political and religious intentions coincide, but considers this fortuitous; the Church, in spite of everything, cannot stop celebrating such festivals because of the fact that some want capitalize on them politically (SS, I, 212; cf. SS, II, 43): the Church has organized Eucharistic Congresses for many years, in times of prosperity and of crisis, in all countries and under all regimes (SS, I, 217).

To the objection to the costs that such Congresses incur, he responds that bullfights, movies, etc., cost no less, and that no one protests them, adding: "Nor does anyone stop attending because this or that authority presides over them and honors them with their presence, or this or that flag is flown." (Ib. 212)

The interest in these matters stems, above all, from the fact that they reflect very well the climate in which Arizmendiarrieta began his labor, as well as the mentality of the young priest who was confronted with hard reality with no more intellectual preparation than what he received in seminary. His thought in relation to faith and to the Church seems to be formed on the basis of St. Thomas, de Balmes, and authors like De Maistre, "the genius with the penetrating gaze" (SS, I, 153), etc., which are quoted in his first writings. His social thought, fundamentally inspired by the doctrine of the Church, seems, however, to run through fairly independent channels, with its own dynamic. Certainly these determine and enrich each other, but differences continue to be observed in his areas of interest. While in theological thought, Arizmendiarrieta shows himself to us as a repeater, and quite well-informed (his knowledge of Strauss, Harnack, Renan, and the Central European Protestant liberals is noteworthy), on the social question, his very personal sensitivity appears from the earliest days, showing him to be a thinker on his own path.

The criticisms of the Church for cooperating with authority, for maintaining cordial relationships with authority, come to nothing, he says: "Anyone searching for something to criticize should look for it where the Church distances itself from the people, not where it deals with authority." (Ib. 215)

Arizmendiarrieta insists on this aspect: because the mission of the Church is just that, because the Church lives in the people, because it is the people whom it needs at all times. The Church is divine, the treasure it keeps is divine, but all those who represent it are human, very human, and run the risk of allowing themselves to be seduced by the goods they own, and by the favor of those to whom they owe such goods. The Church, he will insist, should be poor, to be able to be free and impartial. "Congratulations always to the Church that remains in contact with the people, just as a people that has the Church as its friend is fortunate, for that Church has magnificent means to protect their rights and safeguard their dignity. If it has the Church together with it, no one can ever tyrannize that people, whose consciousness of dignity remains alive, thanks to the doctrine of the Church, which ferments it" (Ib. 214).

### Humanity without God (Considerations on war)

For Arizmendiarrieta, without God, no social life is possible. Without God, "mankind would cease to exist, and mankind must cease to exist if the hand of God does not sustain it, does not care for it." (Ib.) Without God, there is no norm, no connection of consciousness that makes it possible to provide a foundation for social life. There is no more than chaos, to which mankind, over the long term, will succumb irredeemably.

Many peoples and the immense majority of people live today as if God had not incarnated, "as if Christ had not established the only foundations of social co-existence." (PR, I, 102) They have followed the slogan the Heine, "the impious": "let us leave the sky for the sparrows and the angels; we want champagne, roses and the dancing of smiling nymphs." With the help of technology, modern man wanted to transform the land into a paradise, in which he would be self-sufficient, without God. God has been dethroned, man has been brought up in disregard of his commandments. The consequence is that selfishness triumphs, and hatred sows death. "They cross the skies," he writes for the soldiers in 1943, "with no one able to prevent their passage, those artifacts of Technology that threaten to bury mankind under the rubble of that which has been raised at the cost of so much work." (Ib.) They are the consequences of the loss of faith, announced more than a century ago by Dupanloup.[^ch1-42] Where faith in God is lost, and to the extent it is lost, "barbarism, ferocity and slavery advance, symbolized by hammers and sickles or by false crosses." (SS, II, 171)

Quoting Montesquieu, Arizmendiarrieta writes: "it is wonderful that the Christian religion, which offers no other argument more than happiness in the next life, has also consolidated happiness in this one" (Ib. cf. SS, II, 286). That is the only way the early Christian community was possible, in which slave and free, rich and poor, Roman and barbarian, were able to live in equality and full fraternity, because "the fulfillment of the eternal laws in and through Christ erased those differences" (Ib. 103). Distance from God, in contrast, entails chaos and disorder, and the ruin of peace, both external and internal. Selfishness reigns in men, and violence in society. "Where God does not reign, there is war." (Ib. 102)

In the years of the Second World War, these ideas appear very firm in Arizmendiarrieta. A year later, returning once more to the topic of war, it seems to him to have no other explanation than the abandonment of God by mankind. War is absurd. Why do rulers send their people to war? It cannot be ambition for command, or for wealth. "If what has been spent on war had been destined to the production of automobiles, every inhabitant of the Earth, including women and children, could have had a car. And yet there was more than enough money... A billion villas could have been built. Just with what is spent in an hour, houses for a million working families can be made ... With income on the capital invested in military expenses by warring States during these years, all the costs could be covered for the working population all over the world to have a pension, accident insurance, unemployment insurance, disease insurance, etc., for hundreds of years, without the need for them to put in a penny." (Ib. 104)

[^ch1-42]: F. Dupanloup (1802-1878), French prelate, illustrious pedagogue (teacher of Renan); bishop of Orleans beginning in 1849, partisan (with Lacordaire and Montalembert) of the freedom to teach, head of the Catholic liberals under Napoleon III, staunch enemy of the Ultramontane L. Veuillot, contrary to the definition of papal infallibility. Liberal and anti-bonapartist, all his political activity was at the service of the ideal of the restoration. Arizmendiarrieta (PR, I, 102) transcribes the following phrase of his: "Draw away from Christ, ignore his commandments and his teachings... and tomorrow, we will be in mutual frightful disorder, and all our material progress, of which we are so proud, will bring us only to the hands of a studied barbarism and tyranny, to give new and unparalleled strength to oppression and ruin."

War is absurd, it has no possible rational explanation. How to explain it, then? "War is a lash that God wields over a treacherous mankind. Noncompliance with eternal laws has this sanction." (Ib. 105)

Again and again, Arizmendiarrieta insists that "referring to the present calamity, we can assert without fear of error that one of the motives that has moved the Almighty to allow the chain reaction of this World War is to punish the crimes of individuals and of peoples" (SS, I, 105). It does not come only from economic imbalances and the struggle of interests, nor is it only the result of economic or hegemonic objectives, but is, rather, "the consequence of profound moral causes, of the official public negation of the royalty of Christ, of the abandonment of his law of truth and of love, of forgetting human solidarity and Christian charity, of the lack of knowledge of authority and of the Supreme Being and of the moral order established by Him. These laws were so serious and so universal, that [ignoring them] had to result in the universal and nameless disaster we are witnessing" (Ib.).

With the war over, in April of 1946, Arizmendiarrieta keeps insisting on the still-recent "lesson of history": "Let us not forget it, because the lesson is edifying, it is worthy of keeping in mind. Not long ago, man had more than enough bread, to the point where he felt saturated, and even to such a point that its possession and security seemed to be guaranteed, and, in effect, he thought that he no longer needed ask God for it, or hope in God for it. He forgot all about the Our Father, stopped invoking the celestial Father, stopped looking to heaven to remember God the common father, and, of course, did not take long to forget the common brotherhood of all men, who started to look on each other as strange beings, and at last, to consider each other irreconcilable enemies, and thus, civilization, which is first and foremost coexistence, collapsed" (SS, II, 285). When God is abandoned, and mankind appears to have been freed from everything, there is the rise of "those fetishes which have been worshiped with nothing less than rivers of blood" (Ib. 286).

A grave issue is posed here for Arizmendiarrieta. The novelty of Christ's teaching about God stems precisely from its conception of God as Father, giving primacy to love over the Law. "Law and doctrine for Him [God] are not ends, but rather means that help man, who is misled and sick, to arrive at the heart of God, from which he proceeds. Just as the channel or the causeway has the merit of conducting water to its endpoint, so the law and doctrine God gives to man is with the objective that he will return to the paternal lap, and if God urges the fulfillment of those laws through various means, even by punishment and threat, he always does so guided by the feeling of love for man." (SS, I, 101) The precept of loving God, and in God, one's neighbor, is not one of those 613 commandments which the pious Jew must scrupulously fulfill; it is the only precept of the New Law.

However, war, which does not correct, but rather exterminates lives, bears no resemblance to a channel that conducts waters to a good end without losing them along the way; it cannot be understood as a usual punishment with purposes of paternal correction. War, which Arizmendiarrieta recognizes is rationally inexplicable, is also inexplicable from the theological point of view. There remains no another solution than accepting that there exists "a Providence that governs the world and directs all events according to its infinitely wise and just designs" (Ib. 103). That these designs are inscrutable for man is easier to understand, since the finite does not comprehend the infinite. "We can all understand without difficulty that an eagle that glides in the air two thousand or three thousand meters up sees everything—men and events—differently than a chicken pecking in a small yard" (Ib. 105).

This prophetic—or rather, Old Testament—view of history, will not be found again with that crudity in Arizmendiarrieta's later writings. It seems specific to his early years of apostolate, still close to his personal experience of the civil war and as a prisoner of war, and also concurrent with the horrors of the World War. If the idea of war as a punishment from God does not appear again, his conviction remains firm that without God, a just social order is not possible. Years later, in 1967, commenting on the *Populorum Pregressio* of Paul VI, he repeated these words of an unnamed commentator: "Certainly, man can organize the land without God, but without God, ultimately, he can only organize it against man; exclusive humanism excludes. Man can only be realized in overcoming himself. According to the thoughtful words of Pascal, 'man infinitely overcomes man'" (FC, II, 267).

Only once do we find a related observation, in 1965, although in no way could it equate to the conception of war as a punishment from God. After chastising the enormous social differences between rich and poor nations, pointing out that such differences are causes of discomfort and of wars, he adds: "The Empires of today continue to be punished, just as the ancient ones were, with one of the worst divine punishments: blindness. They see prestige only in raising new pyramids, or cathedrals of stone, when there is no greater prestige for a people than that of bequeathing to posterity a cathedral of living stones: a humanity that is better crafted, structured and linked" (FC, II, 74). The text makes a clear allusion, apart from the New Opera of Madrid, etc., to the construction of the Cathedral of the Holy Family of Barcelona. "As the miserable suburbs have surrounded Madrid and Barcelona, the current Empires have been surrounded by suburbs composed of entire nations; the new slaves of the new pyramids" (Ib.).

### Humanity without Christ (Considerations on nationalism)

What favors the succession of ideologies, such as going from liberalism to collectivism, is the widespread anxiety for renewal. In a liberal and individualist regime, man, abandoned to the measureless greed and ambition of the capitalist, has been freed in part, thanks to association. In this respect, the collectivist reaction offers an undeniable positive aspect: "we must recognize that all systems, Marxist or non-Marxist, all social systems have alleviated man and contributed to overthrowing that existing state of things of a century ago." (Ib. 118) Certain bindings have been broken, which has eased the situation of man... "but it is another thing to lead him to a safe endpoint, to create a state of things, a social order, which simultaneously guarantees his subsistence and his existence as a living being, his independence and his freedom; in a word, his personality, his dignity of man" (Ib. 118). "We do not lament and cry because a state of things and a civilization or social order have passed into history in which man was not respected and was not given the consideration and treatment which, for the mere fact of being a man, corresponds to him, and he was considered to be an engine that ran on blood, an extension of machines, a flimsy commodity and subject to the same law of supply and demand. But can our just anxiety for renewal be satisfied with a state of things like the social reality of Europe presents to us? Is the new social order we are anxious for perhaps that which the systems and political and social forms in vogue presage to us?" (Ib. 117).

Given a choice between the two extremes, liberal and collectivist, Arizmendiarrieta's anthropological philosophy leans towards the latter. However, he shows himself to be very critical of it, because he thinks it does not sufficiently guarantee the freedom and dignity of mankind: "man, which, in the liberal and individualist system, had the experience of loneliness and realized that alone, he was nothing, has ended up losing all sense of his personal independence" (Ib.). He has come to understands himself as a mere part of a greater body, which, in the end, means the first step towards "the new slavery," which is to say, the "new form of slavery that oppresses man in collectivist systems, in this absorbent statism" (Ib.). The role that the capitalist assumed before, today is assumed by "society," in other words, public power, which presumes the right to have everything and everyone at its disposal, even the very life of its subjects. "We are in a social order in which the interests of man are not respected for the mere fact of being a man." (Ib. 119) If the dignity of the person is recognized, a person deserves respect and consideration, not for his/her qualities (ideas, situation, etc.), but rather for the mere fact of being a person. But this principle has still not found acceptance in modern social systems. Quite to the contrary, Arizmendiarrieta thinks that, as a reaction to liberalism, modern society is returning to the state of things in paganism, and against which Christianity had to fight for centuries.

For example, among the Greeks, if the individual deserved any consideration, it was not due to his quality of being a man, but because he was Greek, and for no other reason than being Greek. Strangers and barbarians do not deserve any consideration. In Lacedemonia [*Sparta*], a child who was deformed or deprived of some body part was thrown down a chasm by the birth police: he was a person which could not serve or be useful. In Rome, it was the title of Roman citizen that made a man, in fact, a man. "Is there any difference between the spirit that animates our European civilization and what we have just described, when men are inculcated with a patriotism that is so exaggerated that it carries in its bowels hatred for all that is not itself, when every right is reduced to strength, and no more value is recognized in man than those that come from belonging to a nationality, or those that come from the service provided to the State, when the very right to life is not given to man except insofar as the State recognizes it?" (Ib. 120). Modern States sacrifice millions of lives to their security, or to their spirit of revenge, or to their imperialist ambitions, as if the end of human life consisted of backing the ambitions of governments. If it is agreed that man should remain subject to the State, then flinging those who cannot show positive utility to the State into the abyss must be a logical consequence. Along these lines, "the Lacedaemonian legislation has faithful interpreters in Europe today," affirms Arizmendiarrieta, without specifying what he is referring to, although perhaps he is thinking of laws on euthanasia and abortion.

Modern nationalisms constitute one form of collectivism. "It resurrects, with all its strength, the formidable maxim of the ancients, *salus populi*, the salvation of the people, the pretext for so many and such horrendous attacks, the pretext that sometimes wraps itself in the mask of social or common interest, and leads to a frenetic and ferocious patriotism, which superficial men—in the words of de Balmes—admire in the ancient republics" (Ib. 117). Arizmendiarrieta clarifies that in no way does he mean to exalt individualist selfishness that refuses to give its life for the homeland under any circumstances; nor does he want to deny the value of heroism, to the extent that it is just and laudable. But he does believe it necessary to draw attention to the investment of values in many such gestures, when they are inspired and motivated by ideals that in no way are worth the cost of the sacrifice of human lives, like many of the affairs that public powers engage in with financial purposes, or conquest, or revenge—purposes that, in the end, "are the ones, both today and in other times, that induced empires to declare those horrendous wars, which cost so much blood to obtain so little" (Ib. 120). Modern States, endowed with powerful technological means of persuasion, achieve the adherence of their subjects to the extreme of inculcating, as supreme values, attitudes and conduct which really mean the denial of all human dignity. "The very acts of heroism and the very patriotism that are admired and extolled today often have a certain note of sadness to them, because more than an exaltation of human values, more than a testimony of a man who overcomes, they are a violent extortion of a man who is destroyed, of man who, in a supreme gesture, recognizes his own nothingness... sacrificing his life in the interest of ideals that do not deserve such sacrifice and reveal the low esteem we have for ourselves."[^ch1-43]

While Arizmendiarrieta expressed himself in these terms, men continued to give lives "for the homeland" in the battlefields of the Second World War. Would this bloody struggle be possible, wonders Arizmendiarrieta, if man was conscious of his dignity? The investment of values that has gone on is extremely grave. "The gesture of the Roman slave who, not wanting to survive its owner, is killed, is also heroic, if you like, but it reveals to us the destruction of the human personality; we also admire Indian women who calmly throw themselves onto the funeral pyre after their husbands have died; but the heroism of the Roman slaves and the self-denial of Indian women are not an obvious sign of souls, but rather, are the result of not knowing one's own dignity, of imagining oneself consecrated to another being, absorbed by him, of seeing existence itself as a secondary thing, with no more objective than to serve someone else's existence." (Ib. 121)

Modern society is, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, returning to Greek, pre-Christian conceptions, unaware of individual human dignity, as can be seen in two aspects which Arizmendiarrieta argues as examples: the lack of respect for life and modern slavery.

"Wherever life is not seen as sacred, as useless--miserable and weak as it may be--and the killing of a child who has just been born, or who has not been, is not counted among homicides the same as the murder of man in the prime of life, and individuals are not considered to have rights that society must respect, with secrets that it cannot interfere with, or costly sacrifices are demanded that are not first justified by a true need, the spirit of Lacedemonia, of Greece and Rome is revived." (Ib. 125-126)

The most eminent spirits of Greece, like Plato and Aristotle, approved of slavery, just as today, that more refined form of slavery is approved of, "but in the end, is still slavery," which is "the huge mass of workers who are excluded from the banquet of life" (Ib. 126). The situation of these workers, in proportion to the advancement and progress the rest of the world has made in the meantime, has scarcely any advantage over that of the ancient slaves; nor can it be said that "the factory owners, who think that they give the worker everything he is owed and unscrupulously keep those immense benefits, which, in the end, have come from the effort and of the spiritual, technical and material contribution of their workers," deserve a better description than the ancient slave-owners. Arizmendiarrieta preaches hard words in the Parish of Mondragon. "What capitalist or master considers [*their workers*] brothers—as they really are—because if he considered them as such, sons of the same father, sharing in the same inheritance and a common fate, how, in good consciousness, could he take away everything he can carry?" (Ib. 126).

[^ch1-43]: The allusions to "vital space" (SS, I, 125), the Plato quote relative to the regulation of sexual relations to keep the race pure (Ib. 124), etc., seem to indicate that the nationalism to which Arizmendiarrieta primarily refers is German National Socialism.

The parallelism continues: just as Antiquity, lost in darkness, clamored for a redeemer, "from the bottom of this social, political, ethical or moral disorder, also comes a common cry, asking for a saviour." (Ib.) In the pagan world, that clamor was a reliable testimony to the powerlessness of reason to lead man to a new order; today, on the contrary, after twenty centuries of Christianity, "it is, more than anything else, an accusation against us, Christians who have not been able to project the light we have received from Christ over the world, an accusation against those Christian generations who have failed to create a Christian order in the world." (Ib. 126-127)

It is worthwhile here to quote Arizmendiarrieta's Christian self-criticism at full length; it also shows his social rhetoric:

> We, Christians of the twentieth century, must recognize that we are responsible before God, before our conscience and also before history and the world, for these atrocities, for these deviations, for this paganism reigning in all spheres, paganism which we cannot cover up, but rather must unmask and combat, but combat as Christ would combat it, fully accepting his creed and his doctrine, accepting it and living it and bringing it into practice in all spheres, in the moral in the first place; the moral and Christian order which turns on two hinges, which are justice and charity, justice and charity which are equally mandatory in Christian doctrine, justice and charity, which are complements of each other and not, as some would like to think, replacements for each other. And do not believe, as it often seems to be believed, that the political order is independent of the Christian, that it is a sphere in which Christ and his doctrine have no entry; nor let it be believed that while the crucifix hangs on the wall, we are excused from other duties, and that hearts can give free rein to passions of hate and revenge. And, while Christ guarantees respect and obedience to authority, identifying it with himself, “who resists authority resists God,” says Saint Paul; authority has to know that in the Christian conception, to rule is to serve; to serve, in the first place, the interests of families and individuals, because, just as God, the supreme authority, is love and, as such, does not make contact with his children except to fill them with his benefits, in the same way, authority should be in contact with its subjects to dictate rules that are instructive, beneficent, and self-denying. And no less than in the moral and political sphere, Christ also has interests in the social and economic. How many times do we see Christ in the chapel—imprisoned—but refuse to see him in the gears of a safe! And unfortunately, it is very true what they say: "He is supported fraudulently, perhaps no longer with the throne on the altar, but with the treasury on the altar of the Church.
>
> We Christians have done no more than discuss everything, accepting as much as we like of the Gospel; Christians, who, possessing an all-encompassing doctrine of life, have kept what pleased us and abandoned what displeased us about it, we are responsible for all of these disasters, for all of these deviations. And today, in view of that paganism which we saw triumph in ancient times and be reborn in our days, we need to proclaim that we do not believe in the promises of those who do not respect man as man, recognizing in him certain inalienable rights, of those who see in man no more than an animal, a subject, with no more mission than to be useful and advantageous to society; nor do we believe in the Christianity of those have the name of God on their lips, but whose God is not the Christian God, which is the only absolute goal of human life, God the Father, who has other children who deserve the same consideration and the same respect, who must be respected and loved, because they are also children of God, and have the same destiny as us, God the Redeemer who has redeemed man, and not the State, God the Rewarder, who must remunerate man, who is immortal, and who has a supernatural destiny. We believe only in Christ, who has words of peace and eternal happiness, and not only eternal, but also human, the only human happiness mankind is capable of in this vale of tears.

"There are silences that are betrayals": it is the obligation of today's Christians to remind man that he is more than a machine, and also very different from herd animals. It is necessary to oppose modern doctrines which, ignoring human dignity, "bring confusion to minds, and to the social order; they bring a lamentable inversion of values, despotism, and unbearable, brutal, inhumane, and unnatural tyranny." (Ib. 152)

##The ruin of the family

"According to the teachings of physiology, the great struggle between life and death is settled in the narrow limits of each one of the cells that make up the human body, and in the same way, the choice between civilization and barbarism is made around this small social institution we call the family" (SS, II, 61).

In this social cell, the life of society is at stake in both senses: in the immediate and natural sense, the procreation of life, and in the cultural sense, the life of great values. The family is "the first school where we learn to think, and the first temple where we are taught to pray" (Ib. 58, 61).


### Rights and responsibilities of parents

The first right and obligation of parents consists of knowing and practicing their dignity and authority. "A parent is a monarch by natural right," writes Arizmendiarrieta (Ib. 48). But this dignity and authority is not recognized, either by parents themselves, or by the context (especially by the State). Hence, "one of the deepest evils that afflict mankind today, the loss of the principle of authority (while this may seem absurd, it is not authority, but rather brute strength that reigns in the world), has its origin in this surrender of parental authority," (Ib.) which is followed by the universal surrender of the principle of authority, "as our dearly departed Cardinal Gomá says very well." (Ib.) "Civilization is in danger because the family is in crisis." (Ib. 57)

The family, therefore, participates in the current universal crisis; it seems to even be in its origin. But in fact, what has stripped value from the family, according to the young Arizmendiarrieta, is absorbent statism, which ignores and infringes on "the primordial right (of the family) to educate and form with absolute priority over the State" (Ib. 48).

Parents are gravely obliged to have knowledge of their rights, which is to say, to the formation of their consciences regarding their rights and duties, regarding their responsibilities (Ib. 50). Secondly, parents are obliged to form associations, since they cannot effectively defend their rights, nor fulfill, or see to the fulfillment of, their obligations in isolation (Ib. 51). Parents—monarchs and sovereigns—lose all authority as they cross the threshold of their houses: it is not recognized either by society or by the State. "The democratic constitutions of States infringed on their rights by recognizing the same value in the suffrage of the parent, who, as we have said, is a sovereign by right in that first society of the family, and that of any other individual for the mere fact of being an individual. And no less than democratic constitutions, the constitutions of totalitarian States also violate rights of parents, arrogating the right to educate and form children, independent of consent of the parent, to whom this right pertains" (Ib. 52-53).

The rights and obligations of parents as educators and caretakers of children cannot be limited to their own home. They are extended to the street, the plaza, the cinema, the theater. Parents have the inalienable right to the position of being legislators and rectors of everything that has to do with the cultural and social training of children, and should act as such, moralizing, for example, shows, setting schedules for evening shows, etc. (Ib. 54). These are rights and duties which can be acted on only if parents associate.

The best service which parents can provide to mankind is good education of children. "Education is the key to the destiny and future of our youth, and of our society itself" (Ib. 95). Only evil comes spontaneously from inside people, good demands intense work. The resource that makes noble feelings and good ideas bloom in people is education. The moral character of the people of tomorrow depends on this: "man is man more because of education than birth" (Ib.). Arizmendiarrieta thinks that the reason for marriage to exist is more education than procreation itself.

The home should be the last bulwark of spiritual values, of the highest essences of our civilization (Ib. 98). And parents should strive to transmit those values to their children, ideas and feelings with which and because of which mankind feels itself to be such, sacrificing life itself for them, if necessary. "Do you yourselves not love your ideas and your feelings more than your material goods? Are there not many among you that have preferred to lose them before renouncing certain ideas and certain feelings?" (Ib. 96). You can hear the post-war echo in Arizmendiarrieta's words.

Arizmendiarrieta laments the ease with which boys and girls stop attending school. He laments it, first, because without culture, there is no freedom: an uneducated people will have to remain perpetually as minors, unable to administer itself, dependent on those who can, even if it is in the name of the people. Secondly, because he considers "if it is meritorious work to make of any corner of land more productive and beautiful, then it is greatly advantageous to make a human heart richer in feelings and more elevated and noble in its aspirations and desires" (Ib. 100).

The individual is made more by education than birth. The parents, who have procreated the child, must act decisively in education, which cannot be limited to imparting technical knowledge and enough external forms of courtesy to function comfortably in the world. "If man is what he eats, his education is a problem of food; but if we're convinced that man is what he knows and loves, what he wishes and pursues, then his education is a problem of food for the soul; that is, a delicate, internal, constant operation, the molding of his soul, for which all of that well of patience, selflessness, zeal, and insight God has placed in the heart of parents is needed " (Ib. 101).

### The family, source of life

The life of man is ephemeral, but God wanted it to fill centuries in history, perhaps centuries upon centuries (Ib. 61). And the source of life, the legitimate source, is the family. "Why can human life not sprout from another source other than the family?" Arizmendiarrieta is as clear and accurate as he is brief: "Because God did not want it" (Ib. 62). He goes no further on the topic.

On abortion, he states that, fortunately, "the majority of our faithful still have enough moral sensitivity to understand the horror of these practices which, on the other hand, wreak such havoc that they only are comparable with the victims produced by modern wars and, in the judgment of competent researchers, exceed the number from wars" (Ib. 78). He condemns contraceptives and the sterilization laws of Nazi Germany (13 June, 1933), "that country which has presented itself to the eyes of our Christians as a model of social life" (Ib. 80). If there were some in Spain who knew "how to ponder and exalt" Nazi Germany, which presented itself as the most advanced country in Europe, as a social model, etc., Arizmendiarrieta was certainly not among them.

The family deserves more interest as the source of moral and cultural life. "Man is not born good, despite Rousseauian utopias, but rather, profoundly altered in the very constituent principles of his moral being. He is born ignorant, and with a tendency to evil. A small child, who was just born, carries the germ of those tremendous antagonisms between the spirit and the flesh of which Saint Paul speaks. This phenomenon is unique among living beings. Every being has a purpose and a tendency that carries it towards it. Following the causeway indicated or imposed by instinct, they arrive at their purpose; they arrive at full development in all areas. They need nothing more. In contrast, man, without the education of his intellectual and moral faculties, cannot become, by his own strength, what we call man. He will have all the essential constituents of his nature, but will not talk, will not know what is good and evil. He will not be suitable for society and, if God does not grant him extraordinary grace, he would not arrive at his purpose. Education is indispensable, and education is the function of the family" (Ib. 63).

If human nature is not cultivated with the greatest care, people end up being wolves to their peers. In fact, it is not the inclemency of weather, inevitable blows like disease, or the capriciousness of luck that cause us to suffer the most. "The greatest part of our suffering is caused by the lack of will, of attention, of love, and of tolerance that we have for each other" (Ib. 89). Without a careful education, human energy is either wasted or is employed for evil. "In the wild forest, the strength and the vigor of the land is squandered, both on the sap that fertilizes the fruit tree which gives delicious fruit and on that which fertilizes the thorn or briar" (Ib. 89). It is in the family where people can learn to develop human sensibility, noble ideas, feelings of selflessness, detachment, service, love for their peers. "The social training of man starts and is nearly finished in the family" (Ib.).

"We are men," concludes Arizmendiarrieta, "to the extent that we have participated in the human feelings and ideals which we were taught in the family" (Ib. 88).

### Basis of society

Destroying the family not only dries up the current of life at its source, but even if the causeway of life continued to be full, "it would no longer be men who fill the face of the land, they would be monsters" (Ib. 63) and social life would run to its ruin.

Indeed, Arizmendiarrieta believes that it is a clear lesson of history—he likes to argue on the basis of history, "that no people, no civilization, no Empire was capable of surviving the ruin of the family" (Ib.). For example, Rome, etc.

On the other hand, "there is one people in history, a people that has survived all disasters, all misfortunes... which have been many in its life... the Hebrew people, the Israelite people; and part of the explanation of that people with their spirit, with their idiosyncrasy, is rooted in family life" (Ib.).

"The family, in addition to being the office of life, in addition to being the workshop where the best works are embodied, is the vehicle of tradition, is the bond of union between the past and the future. It is what gives stability to mankind" (Ib. 64).

### Marriage

"It is immoral with an intrinsic evil to seek pleasure for pleasure's sake." (Ib. 74). With this terrible phrase, a whole chapter of matrimonial life may close. Arizmendiarrieta is emphatic: selfishness requires this impassable moral barrier. To accept pleasure for itself would be to accept selfishness as good. Whoever wants to combat selfishness cannot accept pleasure for its own sake. It is a matter of logic and consequence, and man "has to recognize the primacy of reason over instinct" (Ib. 70).

On the other hand, "one has the right to pleasure to the extent that he is ready to do what nature demands," and, by the same token, "pleasure must be inseparable from the function to which it must be oriented, to the very purpose of the act" (Ib. 73). People "have to recognize the existence of a natural law which binds all nature, and them, as part of it" (Ib. 70).

The doctrine spelled out in the opening phrase, which Arizmendiarrieta explains as a doctrine that the Church has always supported, does nothing but sanction a law and a standard already imprinted on nature itself, and taught by reason. "Christianity is the antithesis of selfishness, and as a supernatural doctrine and a supernatural religion, there is no philosophical or ethical system that vindicates the rights of nature with such logic, with such exactness, as Christianity" (Ib. 72).

Recently ordained as a priest, Arizmendiarrieta reached Mondragon in February of 1941. Just eight months later, he started to give talks on the family, whose notes are preserved, and we have been able to use them here. This was long before the days in which Arizmendiarrieta, the great reflector of experience, would discover the positive aspects of instinct, of selfishness... which he would accept, directed and domesticated, as positive factors for the building of the cooperative community, which he himself will frequently compare with the family.

The same arguments on natural law and reason will be made to defend indissolubility of the matrimonial bond. Those who, not only by sacrament, but by the very impulse of nature, have devoted themselves mutually, cannot be dissolved (Ib. 67-68): it would be against natural law and against reason, "that reason, that light which is able to foresee everything and required to provide what it has seen" (Ib. 68).

Concerned about the crisis society was suffering, Arizmendiarrieta believed, in these years, that he was able to contribute to the reconstruction of society, renewing family life on solid bases and reinforcing its presence in public life. Society cannot be renewed without first renewing the family, and the family cannot be renewed without defending and protecting marriage, "the cornerstone on which the family must sustain itself, and, what's more, the heart from which the family must receive its life" (Ib. 65). The strength of family life depends on the solidity of marriage, and the future of mankind depends on the strength of family life.

It will be precisely in the virtues on which Arizmendiarrieta works to consolidate marriage, where, beyond the changes his thought will go through over time, continuity can be observed most clearly. The virtues identified as the fundamentals of marriage are, in fact, tolerance, on which he insists (Ib. 83, 84), detachment, selflessness, the spirit of sacrifice, generosity, mutual support, love, fidelity, constance ("marriage is not the tomb of love, but rather of passion" Ib. 82)... A mirror of morality, which will fundamentally be the same one found again, with variations required by the situation, as the basis of the cooperative family.

### The problem of housing

But, together with the frame of ethical values, the reality of the physical setting also contributes to configuring the character of intrafamily relationships. That is why Arizmendiarrieta provided express attention to the topic of housing as a minimum necessary spatial enclave to attain a dignified family coexistence.

We will briefly review the problem of housing, "the most elemental of needs" (PR, II, 40; cf. PR, I, 179-181), for the significance it has in relation to the family, even though in Arizmendiarrieta's writings, the topic is dealt with nearly exclusively on practical aspects. Among the problems in the home, Arizmendiarrieta has no doubt that not having a home is the gravest of all (PR, I, 217; cf. PR, II, 22, 26, 40). These are the early postwar years.

Two theses which may seem familiar to us, to begin: first, our society cannot be healthy while its first cell, the family, lacks for adequate living space. Second: The family or marriage must have an independent home to function in life as corresponds to its nature (PR, II, 6). Family life is not only threatened by the corrosive ideas of liberalism, later inherited by socialism (PR, II, 1), but also by the lack of hygienic conditions and of the minimum necessary comfort in housing. In Mondragon, "a very healthy people regarding ideas" (Ib. 2) this constitutes a much graver danger for the family than liberal or socialist influence: in Mondragon, family life is reduced to a minimum expression, which is how certain attitudes and social convulsions that were seen can be explained. The people of Mondragon live in the tavern, in the street, and are formed by the general environment more than by the family. There is nothing strange about the way various social tendencies are propagated rapidly, when they are the ones that predominate on the street. The general environment is always the most capricious, most fickle, least stable, least moderate. This is how to explain that the people of Mondragon at times appear to be easily infected by the general environment, lacking moderation and stability, at the mercy of the wind that blows (Ib. 3).

And the people of Mondragon—we are reading texts from 1941—cannot satisfy their demands for a certain convenience and comfort at home. They take refuge in the tavern. On the other hand, the people of Mondragon do not lack for a sense of social justice, and can do no less than rebel, seeing that industrial development is due to their work, and being unable to then participate, in proportion to their contribution, in the material well-being they themselves created.

As in other times, they have raised their voice against the existing hygienic conditions in the factories, and have been able, with their struggle, to win the exemplary working conditions they have today; at that time, they rebelled because they lacked those conditions in their own homes. "It is not enough for us to sing the excellence of family life with eloquent phrases, we will move no one with the beautiful idyllics we could write concerning the home, while the listener or reader has to function in darkness or discomfort of a hole in the wall or a small room. It is not enough to lift up our voice against alcoholism, while the tavern is the only comfortable and decent place the worker finds. The family needs its space or independence—this is precisely what is attractive about the home—and with that independence, privacy and mutual trust between its members is possible. And that independence and that space are lacking when several families are grouped into the small frame of a house. As can be seen in the statistics (...), in Mondragon, those cases are more common than what may be believed" (Ib. 4).

For more than ten years, we will see Arizmendiarrieta demand joint action between the authorities and citizens with the purpose of resolving this problem. We see that ultimately, a construction charity ("Mondragon Home Association") is founded in August of 1953.

Years later, in 1967, Arizmendiarrieta again begins to work on the topic of housing, this time, to criticize two excesses which could be an index of the change brought about over those years. He first criticizes the widespread desire, which is not at all reasonable, for each and every person to have a privately-owned house, since the situation of being a tenant lacks social prestige. Secondly, the psychosis of housing, which makes us think that a new house necessarily requires new furniture, new household goods, new everything, leading to such family indebtedness that it can barely be overcome over a long series of years (FC, III, 42-45). In this respect, he criticises the housing policy.

During the last years of his life, with Arizmendiarrieta very concerned about the fate of old people, the topic of housing again emerges, this time from the particular perspective of the needs of this social group: "Provisions must be made so that our men and women in the last stage of their lives have a full urban context, with services and attention in accordance with their particular conditions, when, because of the evolution of the habits of social life, they find themselves more or less alone: this is when it could be most justified to provide apartments with all the necessary community services, affordable to all, at their own discretion. But this assumes a full conception and projection of residences for them" (CLP, II, 112). But this topic remains inconclusive.[^ch1-44]

### Family and the social question

All people, says Arizmendiarrieta, aware of the decadence of mankind that we suffer from, and interested in saving it from the current crisis, agree on the urgency of saving family life (Ib. 59). But the family is being destroyed by proletarianization and standardization, which is the ruin of man and the end of the family (Ib. 60).

Arizmendiarrieta demands, as a minimum of social justice, that women not be forced to leave the home to look for work; that children not have to start to work before an appropriate age; and, above all, the family salary (CAS, 183), which are all demands, he says, that are clearly expressed in papal encyclicals. After praising the new State legislation that establishes the family salary, he continues: "Anyone who reads this quote will believe with true simplicity that it is fulfilled, if not in all, at least in almost all companies, and I think I can assert that not only is it not in all, but rather is in none, where this Pontifical rule [*the sufficient family salary*] is fulfilled" (Ib.). He gives the example of a company with more than a thousand workers (Ib. 184) and which he considers a better case than most businesses: "I understand, then, and I want to reach my first conclusion, which I offer to all employers that boast of being Catholic: analyze the economic situation of the workers' families to be able to aspire to comply with the demands of the living salary demanded by Pontifical doctrine in the name of natural right in the recent social encyclicals" (Ib.).

[^ch1-44]: The Caja Popular wanted continue in the line of Arizmendiarrieta's reflection after his death, cf. Aguirre, I., *Ocio activo y tercera edad*, Caja Popular, 1981

"The first social duty of a businessperson is to organize himself and work so that his employees can earn a salary sufficient to cover the elemental needs of life. And as long this objective has not been achieved, no one has the right to be called a Christian businessperson. I do not know how any benefit can be ascribed to the business that does not reach this goal, nor even how someone who does not feel capable of that can justifiably continue using the title and authority of businessperson" (Ib. 182).

Unjust economic conditions are undoing family life with the misery in which it is forced to exist (SS, II, 58). If is argued that the country is poor, or that the momentary economic situation does not allow real salary raises, Arizmendiarrieta, apart from other observations of the strictly economic kind, replies with the moral argument that is always possible to distribute poverty more equitably (CAS, 185). "One of the things that never ceases to draw attention of foreigners who have visited Spain is the difference in the standard of living that exists in our homeland between the wealthy and the proletarian classes. However natural inequalities may be, when they are disproportionate to the degree of general prosperity of a country, they are unsustainable, and even more so when it is a country that prides itself on following the doctrine of the Gospel" (Ib.).

### In line with a future tradition

The doctrine we just discussed on the family shows us the line that Arizmendiarrieta's thought takes and which he fundamentally will follow until the end. We can highlight two sources, or foundations, of this thought: one is the Church's social doctrine; the other, really the same, but historically implemented in certain social groups that directly influenced Arizmendiarrieta: the tradition of the Basque union and social movement prior to the war of '36.

The fundamental value that Christian social doctrine sees in the family is well known.[^ch1-45] Additionally, this importance increased as the family was seriously affected by forms of totalitarianism and by the war.[^ch1-46] As for the Spanish Church, Rodríguez de Coro observed that while the Spanish ecclesiastical hierarchy did not show itself to generally be very sensitive to social problems in the postwar years, the problem of homelessness was energetically addressed by *Ecclesia* from the very beginning (January 1941). The ruins of the war and the rural immigration to big cities (which, in Euskadi, will start later than Madrid or Barcelona) doubtlessly forced this.[^ch1-47]

[^ch1-45]: The treatise *Códigos Malinas* opens, after an introduction, dedicating the first chapter to the family. It is worth reproducing the first article here, which was quoted by Arizmendiarrieta on several occasions (cf. SS, II, 58): "The family being the source whence we received life, the first school where we learn to think, and the first temple where we learn to pray, it is necessary to combat everything that destroys it or breaks it, and to praise and stimulate everything that favors its unity, its stability, its fertility and its prosperity." *Códigos Malinas*, Sal Terrae, Santander 1962, 58.

According to the same author, the defense of the family as a fundamental value, prior to the State, of its sacred right and duty of the education of children, etc., after the Spanish war, would have a particular and political reason for being. It would shape a decisive chapter in the bitter power struggle between Catholic traditionalists and Falangists, who were partisans of a totalitarian State, which was solely responsible for education.[^ch1-48]

On the importance given to the family by the prewar Basque social movement, a single text will suffice. In 1932, in full statutory euphoria, the PNV started to develop social norms, with the aim of organizing a social Congress which create guidelines for the social structuring of Euskadi, which was believed to be autonomously feasible in a short time. A document drafted for this purpose by "distinguished persons, in solidarity and with recognized competence," according to Policarpo de Larrañaga, refers in its first paragraph (after the introduction) to the family, beginning in the following terms: "The family is the cell of society, and on it rests, as on a granite foundation, all the meaning of the social life of communities. It is the first school, the first temple, the source of life..."[^ch1-49] Arizmendiarrieta would not express himself any other way.

[^ch1-47]: Rodriguez de Coro, F., *Colonización política del catolicismo*, CAP, Saint Sebastian 1979, 200-210. It is necessary to also remember the problem of the insufficient condition of existing housing. According to the United Statistics Service, *El Bienestar en España. Un índice de evolución del nivel de vida para el período 1950-75*, an index of the evolution of the standard of living for the period 1950-75, Madrid 1977, in 1950, only 51% of existing housing had a toilet; 33.7%, running water, and no more than 9% had a bath or shower. To get an idea of the gravity of the problem of homelessness, with which Arizmendiarrieta was confronted, it is enough to say that in Mondragon, according to the SIADECO study, *Industry herri baten azterketa, Arrasate eta bere etorkizuna*, Etor, Bilbao 1972, 49, 74.7% of the current houses (1972, in other words, three out of four) was constructed after 1950.

Larrañaga, "collects Catholic social doctrine and abounds in the social thought of Solidarity" (ELA/STV) (p. 152), rigorously follows the *Códigos Malinas*, both in form and content.

## The working class

From Arizmendiarrieta's first writings, a lively interest in the worker question is observed. However, in the writings from his early years, perhaps because of their character, this is posed more as a religious issue than as really social or political-economic. The evolution of his thought on this problem is clear. Later writings will no longer highlight the family as the cell of social life, but rather the factory. It will no longer be about creating the conditions of a more human life at home, but rather, on the job. Certainly one influence on this evolution was the fact that the acute problem of housing, in the early postwar years, is being solved, while the blind development of capitalism in Euskadi, during the same years, intensifies the worker problem. But helped, without a doubt, by such situations, Arizmendiarrieta will come to a more economic vision of society, in which the factory replaces the family as the core of the social fabric. This period of his thought will be analyzed in the second part of this chapter. For the moment, we limit ourselves, as indicated, to the statements in his first writings.

### Apostasy of the working-class masses

Arizmendiarrieta is very concerned about distancing of the working masses from the influence of the Church, about the apostasy of the working masses.

In the first place, there exist the cores, considerable groups of workers, who already publicly flaunt of their lack of religion and who do not hide their hatred for the Church, who vulgarly were called reds (CAS, 15). It is a grave fact in itself, since the mission of the Church is to win everyone for Christ; but it would not be so important if it was not accompanied by the phenomenon of general indifference. It is not only they who find themselves separated from the Church: "it is all or almost all the workers, even those who externally still practice religion and go to church, who are also intimately unlinked, disconnected from the Church, because they have lost trust in her and in the solutions she advocates" (CAS, 15-16). It is the workers who remain united with and trust in the Church who are the exception, such a small number that it can barely be taken into consideration, because they do not represent anything; the rest, which is to say, almost all, have lost all trust in doctrine, in the methods of the Church, in the Church itself; "in a word, they have personally apostatized from the Church, even when they externally remain united to her" (Ib. 16). They will have to end up breaking all external ties, taking the position of those who already flaunt their impiety.

The problem is grave. First, because the mission of the Church is to preach the gospel to the poor, and it is precisely the poor who "leave the Church because they feel that we who represent it are helpless; they leave the Church and abandon faith because they do not find in us solutions for the pressing problems in their lives" (Ib.).

It is also grave because, in many cases, we are talking specifically about people who are very sensitive to the truth and to justice, people of magnificent dispositions. "Does the Gospel, message of life, teach us nothing more than to live on our knees? Does the Gospel, perfect code of justice and charity, teach us nothing more than to live for heaven, with the kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven, having no reflection here on Earth?" (SS, II, 21).

"One would have to be quite deaf or live very far from where we are not to take heed of one of the most widespread complaints among all working people, victims of unbearable conditions of life. This most grave complaint to which I refer is harshly censored by the activity of the hierarchy and of the clergy, who pretend not see or do not see the very heavy burden that weighs upon the weak, upon the workers, and they do not raise their voice to condemn all those mercantile procedures that exploit the need and hunger of the people, or the apathy or evasiveness of the authorities who do not provide this problem all the attention it deserves. Nobody should be shocked at what I say; I do nothing more than affirm a fact, without passing any judgment" (SS, II, 306).

The distancing from the Church and the enmity against Christians are not due to the doctrine of the Gospel itself, or the Popes. On the contrary, these continue to be considered beautiful and just doctrines by the workers. Distancing, and sometimes hatred, come from the contradiction that Christians show when, on the one hand, they publicly profess those doctrines and, on the other, in their social, moral, and economic life, completely disregard them and organize a world totally differently from what they say they profess (Ib. 272).

The apostasy of the masses does not come, then, from the insufficiency of Christian social doctrine, but from the inadequacies of people who do not practice it, and make themselves responsible for its disrepute. In the middle of everything, Arizmendiarrieta discovers a ray of hope in this evil. Our situation (that of Christians) would have been desperate, he observes, if we had done our part to confront evil, if we had lived our Christianity fully, if we had faithfully applied the social principles of our doctrine, and in spite of everything, we had seen the world leave the path, and go off in other directions. But we still have not seriously faced those demanding masses, with their thirst for justice, offering them the practice of our social doctrine; it has been left in the Encyclicals, and the Encyclicals left in the archives. And this encourages us today, because doctrine is to be practiced and lived (Ib. 217; cf.Ib. 200, 291): there is not a failure of doctrine, but rather the failure of its application.

### Social action of the Church

We must begin by remembering that for Arizmendiarrieta, the intervention of the Church in the social question is never about apostolate work with the purpose of winning workers for the Church: Arizmendiarrieta is firmly convinced that the social question has no solution outside of the doctrines of the Church, since neither liberalism nor collectivism provide any acceptable solution. Sometimes, Arizmendiarrieta declared in the first National Assembly of Technicians of Catholic Action, what leads us to think about social work is not necessarily this feeling of the good of the worker, a generous feeling of justice or charity, but rather a rather narrow zeal and interest in the conquest of souls, as if they had to be won with a baited hook (CAS. 143).

When the Church's social doctrine is referred to, in reality, very ancient principles are referred to, as he himself will underscore—basic, like the dignity of man, of the worker, etc., but which still are waiting to be put into practice. The social doctrine of the Church, which later admits various possible formulas for being put into practice, is the basis of the search for the "Third Way," beyond collectivism and liberalism, blind violence and unlimited freedom.

Arizmendiarrieta does not want to conceive of the social action of the Church "as something that can and must be constrained in the narrow limits of a formula and of assorted formulas designed *a priori*. While it is true, on some occasions, that the perfect is the enemy of the good, when it comes to social problems, it is easy to find that, in fact, certain manipulated and massaged formulas, magnificent in their apparent structure, are not viable, or that working to carry them out with the purity of their schematic simplicity entails so many drawbacks that, in fact, it is not worth the trouble of adopting them as redemptive signs" (Ib. 175). Liberalism, collectivism—Arizmendiarrieta recognizes that all systems have positive aspects, and all of them have somehow contributed to the development of mankind. If there is a need to strive to find other solutions, it should not be so much to combat those systems, but to find solutions that are more appropriate to human dignity.

A unique, concrete formula, fixed in all its terms, which need only be put into practice, cannot be deduced from the Church's social doctrine, or from the Gospel. The gospel is a source of inspiration, not a cookbook. By "social action" (of the Church), Arizmendiarrieta understands, therefore, "a disposition of the spirit with which one runs in parallel with the times, a detachment from formulas and the ballast of interests, so that one can empirically accommodate aspirations and confront problems, because every moment and every place has a particular character" (Ib.).

Christians have been unable to create social order in accordance with their doctrines. It could be said that there has not even been a serious attempt to do so: Christians possess good doctrine and bad praxis, or rather, no praxis (Ib. 45-46; 87), a sad fact, which, for Arizmendiarrieta, turns out to be an incentive and a reason for optimism, given the failure of the other two paths.

Together with those who still maintain a relationship and a certain faith in the Church, the principles of Christian social doctrine must begin to be expounded. But these constitute a minority, with the immense majority of the workers separated from the Church, at least in the sense of that they expect nothing from her. To talk to them about the encyclicals will not make much sense, because they will immediately respond that the encyclicals have already existed for a long time, but that Christians themselves are not capable of putting them into practice, and it is as if they did not exist. This is why Arizmendiarrieta thinks that "we do not so much need the Encyclicals, but rather men who have assimilated the doctrine and the spirit of these Encyclicals" (Ib. 18).

"The great enterprise that the Christian apostolate must undertake in our day is the restitution of trust to those masses that still remain faithful to her, at least externally, and then the attraction of all those who are distant" (Ib. 104). But that trust can be only won "when we have provided workshops and factories with men who have an exquisite social sense, with men with a well-developed social spirit, capable of promoting social action in tune with the circumstances in those sites; men capable of earning the trust of their workmates, men to whom the others look and who constitute carriers and representatives of all the desires for justice and equity of the others" (Ib. 18).

A worker is not won with good words. Many workers, says Arizmendiarrieta, have no difficulty recognizing that the Church possesses an excellent social doctrine, better and more perfect than any other (Ib. 104-105). Nor do they fail to recognize, many of them, that all that the term "socialism," or "communism," can evoke has provided meager results to respond to the need of contemporary man. Not everyone, even among the very followers of such doctrines, is fooled by the illusion that the socialization of the means of production is capable of resolving the grave issues of life in all aspects. "But they conceive of us Catholics as incapable of applying even the smallest part of our doctrine, and it tells them nothing that a given law is inspired by Christian principles, because they see that all that is trampled every day by others who ceaselessly flaunt their Catholicism. We will not win these with exposure to doctrine. I do not mean that the preaching, instruction or teaching of social doctrine are unnecessary—far from it. They are not enough. Nor has it usually been the speculative arguments of Marx's *Capital* that has brought them to the enemy ranks, but rather the actions and the spirit of men who, imbued with those ideas or justifying their social reaction to injustice with those ideas, have been able to gain their trust and have been able to confront injustices with integrity" (Ib. 105; cf. Ib. 18).

There is no reason to see any contradiction between this last statement and Arizmendiarrieta's insistence on underscoring the strength of truths, of ideas. Rather, Arizmendiarrieta has always insisted that ideas should be embodied in people. Arizmendiarrieta then demands dedication to study from those men with social spirit, who must gain the trust of their workmates, (SS, II, 251-251; CAS, 105-107). "We must form these elements. This should be the first concern of our apostolate" (CAS, 105).

Social action, understood in the sense indicated above, was spread especially through Catholic Action. Catholic Action, Arizmendiarrieta insists endlessly, should not be identified with any social formula. "It must be kept in mind that in this social field, the fundamental difficulty of every advance, for one and all, is the excessive attachment to immediate and personal material interests" (Ib. 176).

This insistence on denying the possibility of identifying the Church's social doctrine with a concrete formula makes one think that the issue was not so much a general principle, but a problem posed by a State that defined itself as Catholic and its economic policy as inspired by the social teaching of the Popes. Arizmendiarrieta did not want to allow himself to be framed in any political Upper Room, nor did he want to allow Catholic Action to be. "What Catholic Action has never been, is not, and will never be, is a vine that needs political support." (SS, II, 233-234).

Working people, he already says clearly in 1945, see the Church at the service of the State. "The Army, the Clergy and the Falange are the three claws of the capitalist," it is said and believed as dogma among them, and it is difficult to uproot this idea from their mindset. It is not enough that we instruct them in social doctrine. With that, we will not win their trust; they already recognize that we know how to preach a very good doctrine. They need to see us together with them, suffering with them. We need to win their heart" (PR, I, 91).

Among the causes Arizmendiarrieta cites (1945) for Catholic Action not working well in the Diocese of Vitoria, with its established religious spirit, and where so many other religious associations are flourishing, is a "suspicion among a very numerous sector of the faithful, from the moment it was presented at the end of the war, coinciding with the consolidation of the dominant political situation, about the political undertones of the people who, in those moments, began to appear among their ranks and their leaders, who were almost inevitably welcomed and trusted by the rulers, because of the intelligence and mutual cooperation between the civil authorities and the leaders of Catholic Action in gatherings and public events, which gave attendees the conviction that Catholic Action and this regime were all one, and mutually supported each other, and because of the publications, flags, hymns, etc., that confirmed those suspicions, all of which constitutes a powerful motive that has created an attitude that is little less than hostile in a very high percentage of the people, many of them sincerely religious (...). There are towns where those suspicious people make up as much as eighty percent, and in most towns of Guipuzcoa and Biscay they make up more than sixty percent" (PR, I, 70-71).[^ch1-50]

Arizmendiarrieta tries to reinforce Catholic Action as a means of Christian social action precisely because he hopes for it to be able to gather to its bosom all sincerely Catholic people, and those of lively social consciousness. "It is," he says, "the only association that can make the Church independent of the guardianship of political parties and of partisan Catholics who do so much damage when they do not know to leave that partisan overtone out of their Catholic behavior. It offers a channel for ordered, effective, uniquely Catholic behavior" (Ib. 75).

"It is not necessary," he repeated in 1955 in Saturrarán, "for those of us who want to present ourselves as Catholics to act on a plan as a united front, we could almost say as a compact group, with a single way of interpreting the social doctrine of the Church. The social doctrine is abstract and general enough that various interpretations can always be made of it, and, on the other hand, social life, in turn, is also complex enough that the behavior of different people can take a variety of forms. The only unforgivable thing for those who call ourselves Catholics is, perhaps, conservatism and inaction. The action can be highly varied, if we attend to circumstances of form, of rhythm, and of vigor. No doubt Christian groups of men from various origins and political-social labels have carried out magnificent social work. Let us not forget that many of the attitudes that at one time were described as extreme or excessively bold and reckless, with the passage of time, we have found to be normal and sound. The experience of what has occurred in this field of social activity predisposes us to be cautious about being too quick to condemn some attitudes as revolutionary, and therefore inappropriate" (CAS, 235-236).

Arizmendiarrieta wanted to save the independence of the Christian message at all costs. "We are all cramped," he wrote in his notes. "The Church, the ecclesiastics, the secular, both employers and workers. We each have our idol, our solution, our formula, and behind that, our own love, if not our pesetas, to defend, conserve or increase. Which is good because it is ours. If there are no great souls, it is not because there are no souls capable of heroic acts, but rather, they are incapable of daily service, of small sacrifices. If there is no Christian social action in tune with the times... it is because every one is comfortable and surreptitiously installed in his selfishness or comfort. Souls are not opened... Souls open to hearing others..., souls open to admitting the goodness of different formulas... and trying them out in practice..., souls that hold dialogue..." (Ib. 176).

[^ch1-50]:Among the causes for Catholic Action of the Diocese of Vitoria not working well, the lack of faith in it on the part of the workers is mentioned, and, most surprisingly, on the part of the priests themselves and the clerics because of ignorance, etc., and because "they suffer the consequences of that silent campaign, ably carried out against Catholic Action and against the influence of the secular cleric, particularly by the Fathers of the Company of Jesus, from the pages of their very widespread magazines, and more, from the centers that they direct and even the retreats and exercises directed at priests, from the most remote village to the rooms of the Diocesan Seminary itself, and not excluding exercises directed at the secular, where, even when they do not say anything directly against Catholic Action and they abstain from orienting souls towards themselves, they always allow some commentary or some little phrase to escape, leaving a bad taste. This work, not being silent, has continued to make a dent in the mood of the priests themselves, to say nothing of the faithful" (PR, I, 72).

In fact, Arizmendiarrieta, as early as 1946, did not hide his sympathies for democratic socialism, especially for British laborism, as can be seen in his writing on the right to property (CAS, 68-69; 71, 76), sympathies that manifested rather indirectly through all his writings of these years.

### The priest's work

Disregarding other reasons or principles which advised this position, Arizmendiarrieta preferred political and social neutrality of priests towards parties and associations because he considered it urgent to remake unity in the people (PR, I, 19), in his concrete case in Mondragon, where "fratricidal struggles, hatred, and vengeance have, for many years, opened some very deep wounds, which must be healed" (SS, II, 226-228; PR, I, 17). The idea that it was necessary to forget the old positions—liberals, Marxists—and to start to raise a new order, on new foundations, was very profound in him. For this reason, it was necessary to be able to renounce the formulas and know how to dialogue among all, to raise up the new order.

It will demand of every priest an identical posture of material and spiritual austerity. "It is not possible to approach the social field without a great detachment from material goods, but nor can anything effective be done day by day without a nearly absolute spiritual detachment. By "spiritual detachment," we mean a lack of concern for, and the relinquishment of, all those ideas and feelings that are purely and exclusively evangelical. We have to ignore all other ideological constructions to be able to approach the masses. What the times have produced are as variable as the times themselves, and can even be debatable by the necessary people the times have provided to themselves" (CAS, 192).

He compares the social apostle with David, who must confront a powerful giant who has all the elements in the world in his favor: Goliath, the authentic figure of temporal power, of money, of ambition, of overlapping machinations. With his armor, he is hidden from every human risk and can challenge anyone. To confront him, David first tried on Saul's royal armor, but saw that it was too heavy for him. He chose to fight with poor weapons and freedom of movement. "The social apostle of our days needs that interior freedom, which he will enjoy if he conforms to values, with evangelical affections and interests. This is how he can be molded to everyone, and will be Hebrew with the Jews, and Hellenic with the Greeks: he will be no more than Christian, Christian above all" (Ib. 193). Only with this disposition will a priest be able to come to a meeting of the workers and enter into dialogue with them; it will be possible for the trust which the poor once placed in Christ to be reborn.

Here is the catalogue of virtues Arizmendiarrieta establishes for the priest who wants to act in the workers' world: 1. Freedom, 2. Disinterest and detachment, 3. Spirit of sacrifice and service, 4. Austerity, 5. Charity (Ib. 209). Elsewhere, these virtues are reduced to three: freedom, austerity, and industriousness, the latter revealing a new aspect, compared to the first catalog cited (Ib. 214). Naturally, Arizmendiarrieta did not pursue any systematic goal in establishing such lists of virtues of social apostles, but it will be helpful to observe how he reasoned its necessity. "The life of the priest who wishes to support his teaching with life," he says, referring to industriousness, "has to be one of intense work, because in the mentality of the people who surround us, work is one of the great undisputed values, and perhaps for many, we priests are little more than undesirable bureaucrats, because they do not see us as consecrated to work. Between them and us there will be a stream of mutual sympathy from the moment that they can consider us true workers: let us work on what we can. Let us work in schools, let us work in assistance to the sick, let us work in the formation of youth, let us work even in the care and cleaning of our temple. Let us be the first worker of the parish or the town. But let us work also disinterestedly" (Ib. 212-213).

With these dispositions and virtues, the social apostle will be able to establish relationships with the working masses. But the temples and parish centers, Arizmendiarrieta observes, are not the places where they tend to congregate: whoever wants to approach them must go and coexist with them wherever they ordinarily are. Only there can there be spontaneous and natural contact, since forced or imposed contact makes souls close and all action elusive. The priest must be present in the places of recreation, of meeting, in the neighborhoods of the workers, and his physical presence must be accompanied by a "sincere and intensive social co-existence and true spiritual rapport. This experience and rapport require of the priest a sufficient sensitivity, no longer just to understand, but even to intuit the problems and concerns of the worker" (Ib. 134-135).

However, Arizmendiarrieta is absolutely opposed to the appointment of chaplains of factories, while he is sympathetic to the movement of worker priests. The chaplain of a factory will be inevitably seen by the workers as an ally of the boss; and if he is truly interested in the situation of the workers, he will easily enter into conflict with the directors of the business (Ib. 135-136).

The social apostle must be informed on social doctrine, but does not need to be a social technician who knows how to resolve concrete matters. He must inspire; workers themselves must learn to search for the concrete solutions required. "The people, the masses, are not demanding this or that social work from us, this or that activity, but rather this spirit of understanding, this compassion and intelligence about their moral and material problems" (Ib. 193). Many priests excuse their social apathy, alleging that they are not given concrete orientation, that they do not know about that. Arizmendiarrieta is confronted on several occasions with this objection (Ib. 175, 193, 210, 214, 226, 235). "Nor have they told the doctor what prescription he has to give on every occasion," responds Arizmendiarrieta (Ib. 210). It is impossible to proceed with received prescriptions and formulas. There would be no lack of doctors, if this system of prescriptions and formulas was possible.

There is a warning that the social problem is posed in a field of technical efficiency, with such a complexity of elements that are presented concatenated such that, when it is difficult to foresee the circumstances of their development or evolution, certain reservations must be accepted in the concrete formulas.

>The Church is the guardian of the true dignity of man and subordinates the combination of all the elements which condition man's existence to the demands of his dignity and destiny" (Ib. 226).

This is how, free from formulas, the task of the social apostle is fundamentally reduced to two fields: formation of consciousness and the promotion of social initiatives (Ib. 96 ff.).

Arizmendiarrieta laments that the Church, with its preaching and teaching, has managed to create a fairly accurate mentality and standard in the masses about other matters in life, and hardly done anything to build social consciousness. Where are the campaigns against abuses in commerce, against excessive profits in sales and industry, against insufficient wages, against immorality in business? The silence of the Church compromises very sacred interests. In imparted moral instruction it is undoubtable, says Arizmendiarrieta, that the teaching of moral principles as applied to professional life is lacking (Ib. 96-97). There are silences that are betrayals.

Secondly, the social apostle should promote entities in the defense of the poor, of aid and social development. In what industrial town of our diocese, wonders Arizmendiarrieta, could businesses, individually or collectively, not implement health or life insurance, on their own, long before the State made them do so, and, naturally, with lower premiums than those that are demanded now, and with more morality and efficacy in its application? If there was spirit and social initiative, practices of this kind would not be lacking. But in general, we continue to expect that it will be the State that takes care of giving solutions, forgetting what we ourselves we could solve, and what, even after the State has intervened, still remains to be done. What town or industrial zone cannot provide means to put an end to the plague of tuberculosis? However, nothing is done, and the day will come when the State will have to intervene, costing much more and having to bear all this burden. The same thing could be said about housing, teaching, etc.

Finally, the Church possesses various centers of social action, like dispensaries, etc. It is urgent that the workers themselves take responsibilities in such centers. "We all recognize the hazards of disorganized and irresponsible masses, and the urgency of transforming them into an organized and responsible people. For this, it is necessary that each one, or the majority of society, feel an interest and responsibility for something. Even when worker participation seems premature to us in some positions that require a lot of preparation and maturity, we are not ever going to obtain those conditions if we continue to exclude them from everything, as if they were minors, making them maintain a passive stance" (Ib. 141). Social assistance works are to provide workers with material relief, but these works can also provide a spiritual satisfaction as great or greater than the material, from the moment in which their thought, opinion or judgment is given a role in their organization and orientation. There is no motive to avoid their participation; on the contrary, they must participate, if they are not to be condemned to inevitable opposition or passivity. Workers, like all others, have a sensitive heart, and their feeling of dignity is hurt with the excessive paternalism that is shown by treating them as minors.

The social doctrine of the Church requires that the worker find a place on the job as the intelligent and responsible being he is. In words of the prelate M. Ruoast, "if one wants the worker to work, it is necessary to not treat him as a beast of burden, but rather as an intelligent being who is made to understand the need for his effort (...)... He must be freed of his status as passive subordinate, to become an intelligent collaborator" (Ib. 93). The Church should begin by applying this principle to its own house. The Popes call for worker participation in even the running of the national economy, but then we find ourselves reticent to agree to their participation in a town dispensary (Ib. 197). "We do not pay due attention to the need to treat the laborers or workers, or men in general, like intelligent beings. And we would affirm that, in this, we priests run into a great difficulty, because almost by the very nature of our dignity, we tend to be authoritarian, absorbent and personalist, and our works can easily suffer from this defect" (Ib. 196).

### Christianity and social emancipation

Can the Christian struggle against injustice? How are justice and charity related? These two matters should be dealt with here briefly, even though Arizmendiarrieta's reflections that we will present are from later times.

#### Gospel and social struggle

The first issue emerges from the Beatitudes, which define the Christian: blessed are the poor, the meek, the persecuted, etc.; "resist not evil; rather, to the one who strikes you on the right cheek, offer the other also; to the one who would sue you for your tunic, give also your cloak," etc. (Matthew 5:39 ff). How can such texts coexist with a decisive spirit of struggle social?

Arizmendiarrieta responds by quoting the following words of Mounier: "The Christian can accept, for his perfection, suffering the injustice that strikes him. It is a question of private asceticism. But the Christian is not alone in the world, and can reconcile, without contradiction, the desire to not fight injury with the duty to struggle against the establishment of injustice in the world. A regime like modern capitalism is a sort of social sin. It is no longer against affliction itself that the Christian must fight, but rather against Evil. And it is well-known that such combat requires everyone" (FC, IV, 61; Ib. 62). What is in question is what Christian consciousness can give of itself socially. And for Arizmendiarrieta, there is no doubt that the cooperative experience, for example, is a practice of the development of methods of combat and self-improvement inspired by this Christian consciousness. "Bread for me," Arizmendiarrieta recalls, "is a material problem, but my neighbor's bread is a spiritual problem" (Ib.), clarifying that bread means the synthesis of all human problems.

The answer does not seem at all satisfactory: every legitimation of social struggle is made to rest on the rights of one's neighbor, not on one's own, which, apart from perhaps not being very realistic, is clearly insufficient within Arizmendiarrieta's general conception. In effect, he recognizes, on the one hand, that a certain level of material well-being is necessary for personal development: from which it should be deduced that man must struggle for himself, at least until he has insured the minimum level necessary to save his human dignity. And, on the other hand, Arizmendiarrieta conceives of man as a being in constant development, by his very nature, which also seems to demand the struggle against impediments to personal development. Social struggle, therefore, should be able to be legitimated both in the name of one's neighbor and in one's own name. Arizmendiarrieta does not do so, perhaps to highlight the values of generosity, solidarity, etc., and because, without doubt, putting man himself as an end and objective of the struggle puts him in danger of falling into the same thing for which he has so sharply criticized liberalism and collectivism. Even with all this, and although the idea of inalienable personal development is the most fundamental part of Arizmendiarrieta's conception (continuous creation), juxtaposed with this are the teachings on evangelical meekness, which certainly are not in the perspective of human development and promotion, without considering that between the positions, some conflict may emerge.

In Arizmendiarrieta's religious thought, without doubt, creation plays a much more important role than redemption, which is to say, original sin does not seem to have a place in him, and the cross is reduced to little more than personal asceticism. Because of all this, his concept of the Christian closely resembles a humanism of an ascetic cut, in which God equals the absolute Ideal (without forgetting his significance as Creator) and Jesus Christ appears as the Teacher and moral model (not without reason does he consider Cicero and Seneca as very close to Christianity) (SS, I, 109-110). Consequently, Arizmendiarrieta's Christian man always appears as "most human," "most man," that is, most free, most generous, etc. Man, incomplete nature, is brought into its human plenitude by Christianity. These are habitual expressions of his: "neither as a man, nor as a Christian," "no Christian, or even a humanist" can talk, for example, about justice without referring to charity, etc.

It is surprising, therefore, that for him the idea of social struggle and, most concretely, of the meaning of cooperativism, is a complement to the passion of Christ, an idea that appears only once in his writings, during Holy Week of 1962. It seems like another test, as many of his ideas were born along the way.

Arizmendiarrieta wants cooperators to deepen in the "cooperative mystique," to realize the value and scope of what they are doing, and of the rich content of the cooperative movement. The ideal is vast, without limits, a truly revolutionary idea, Arizmendiarrieta insists. "A new world is being born today, there is a clear trend towards a new society, one that is more just, more human, and in this tendency, we cooperators have a very important role to play." Cooperators cannot be satisfied simply because things are going well for them, or because they have been able to demonstrate the error of the many who opposed such an experiment, arguing that it was a utopian ideal and not realizable in practice. It is certainly not about that: "it is simply and fully about the birth, and about collaborating on the gestation and delivery, of a new society, of a new world. Let us not forget, birth is painful" (FC, I, 105). The cooperator should never forget that being a cooperator could, one day, perhaps not so distant, demand true sacrifices and deprivation, and that he must be willing to accept them.

Other than the distances, between the passion of Christ and the cooperative movement, a marked parallelism can be noted: as Christ, "in the pains of his passion, gave birth to a new man, a new society," so the cooperative movement, between sacrifices and deprivation, cooperates in the birth of a new man and of a new social order. Arizmendiarrieta uses the words of Saint Peter, that it is necessary "to complete what the Passion of Christ lacks."

"It is, then, and I do not believe it is presumption to say so, a task of co-redemption, a collaboration with Christ in the redemption of men, at the same time as it is a collaboration with God in the task of creation and its perfection" (Ib. 107).

This work, Arizmendiarrieta keeps insisting, must demand from us sacrifices, selflessness, surrender to others, frequently quashing our disorganized material interests and our selfishness. The position of the true cooperator must be one of openness, of generous acceptance and total surrender to the requirement of the ideal. "I think that we all, more or less, dream of Easter day, we yearn and sigh for the birth of this child that we are gestating today, of that society made for man, tailor-made and at his service, in that society, which undoubtedly will arrive, as the radiant morning of the Resurrection arrived, in which man, served by all things and master of them, becomes ever more man, more free and happy, and definitively nearer to God and open to the grace of the Redemption. But let us not forget that radiant Easter came after the painful Passion" (Ib.).

#### Charity, complement of justice

Many times charity has been understood as a "replacement" for justice (or rather, for the lack of justice) (SS, I, 127), which turns out to be insulting for those who are charitably served. Charity, in this sense, can only be vanity or hypocrisy, and not what it should be, the "complement of justice." Whoever does not feel it and does not practice it this way can be considered a trafficker in feelings that man does not have for sale (PR, I, 178).

The Christian, who believes in transcendence, must be equally able to embody faith in earthly realities. It continues to be surprising that Arizmendiarrieta, generally very attentive to data, statistics and problems in his reports, in the Elkarte Eguna of 1974 has a special reminder to those for whom "the living of transcendence does not attenuate substantivity and the interest in the tangible, visible, temporary, and therefore, the appeal and cultivation of other energy coming from, or nested in, the deepest recesses of the human spirit, faith and hope as well as charity, interpreted in its most theological sense, complement or harmonize with all the more circumstantial or temporary commitments" (CLP, I, 226).

No Christian, or even humanist, can talk about social justice without likewise referring to charity. The reason is that the law wants to establish an order of reciprocal duties and rights between men, starting from the recognition of their equality and dignity. But the establishment of such an order finds a large obstacle in the human will, in selfishness. "The only force that, above all else, can make us want and respect order is mutual love. That effective, broad, and generous love can only sprout from a Christian religious conception, which encompasses everyone as children of God and unites them in the common destiny of the present and future life. Justice needs the complement, the excellence of love, Christian charity" (CAS, 41-42).

Charity urges us, then, to the fulfillment of justice, and is a social bond that invigorates all others and perfects them. If, in our world, charity is regarded with suspicion, even with contempt, it is because it has been disfigured. "Love denies no right, but rather makes it less rigid. It reduces no duties, but rather makes them easier. It does not destroy social distinctions, but takes away the abyss which lies between them. All the social vices that oppose love, such as envy, hatred, anger, contempt, and pride, are causes and sources of injustice, while love, in social life, results in comprehension and mutual tolerance, in resolving differences and union" (Ib. 42).

Finally, Arizmendiarrieta states, along with the *Quadragesimo Anno*, that justice alone, even the most perfect, could make the differences and causes of social struggles disappear, but would never be able to unite hearts and link spirits. Therefore, "without the climate of charity, justice will be incapable of assuring true social peace and general well-being" (Ib. 43).

It no longer seems surprising that Arizmendiarrieta considers the Eucharist "the great social sacrament," "the Christian culmination of the rights of mankind, of the rights of man" (SS I, 210-211). For a believer, who accepts that "each man, each Christian, is a veil that covers the Most High, which is why the neighbor is Jesus Christ present in him" (SS, I, 135), loving God means loving one's neighbor, and vice versa. In this way, "the proclamation of the rights of Jesus Christ is the affirmation of the rights of the disinherited" (Ib. 218).

We can conclude with the observation, now understandable, that for Arizmendiarrieta, religious life, generally, fulfills very "human" functions. This is how the sacrament of penitence is considered in the perspective of the austerity necessary for the conquest of freedom ("Christian penitence as a means to ones own liberation." SS, I, 178), prayer as a means of obtaining inner tranquility and firmness, etc. Arizmendiarrieta has a wonderful phrase, which he appears to owe to A. Carrel, that deserves to be transcribed: "Prayer produces as palpable effects the proper functioning of the glands, which is reflected in that air of satisfaction, joy, optimism..." (Ib. 236).

## Doctrinal framework

What sources nurtured Arizmendiarrieta's thought? It has already been indicated, when talking about the family, that the thought of the early Arizmendiarrieta should be understood, basically, as a development of Christian social doctrine, as it was habitually developed in the academic life of seminarians. Now, trying to frame it more broadly, there is the need to insist on this again, though without forgetting that this was not his only source.

An in-depth study of Arizmendiarrieta's sources does not turn out to be easy, because in his writings, he very rarely cites the sources used. This difficulty is compensated by the fact that his library has been preserved almost intact, as well as his file cabinet and his notes.

His religious thought (God the Father, Divinity of Christ, nature and grace, etc.) seems to rest on the theological literature that was common among priests around the years of the Civil War. It is notable that, with his theological studies finished in 1940, almost no theological books found access to his library after that. Hans Küng is an exception. This continues to be significant.[^ch1-51]

The opposite happens with social issues: his library was endlessly enriched in this field. (In the bibliography we attach at the end of the book, the titles from his library have been collected which may be considered most significant).

However, when it comes time to frame or historically situate Arizmendiarrieta's thought in general, two sources or spheres should be especially highlighted, from which and in which he developed constantly: these are Christian social doctrine and the Personalist philosophy (Maritain, Mounier). Below we refer to both, briefly, leaving the relevant details in each case for the relevant place.

[^ch1-51]: From what we have been able to infer with difficulty, the theological books most used for his conferences and sermons appear to have been the following: Buysse, P., *Los fundamentos de la fe* [*The Fundamentals of Faith*]. *Dios, el alma y la religión* [*God, the Soul and Religion*], Ed. Litúrgica Española, Barcelona 1930. Olgiati, Mons. F., *Silabario del cristianismo* [*Syllabary of Christianity*], Ed. Luis Gili, Barcelona 1940. Sertillanges, A.D., *Catecismo de los incrédulos* [*Catechism of the Unbelievers*], Ed. Poliglota. Barcelona 1934. As can be seen, the apologetic and rationalist tendency strongly dominates.

### Pontifical doctrine

The feeling of finding oneself in a world in bankruptcy, or in a total crisis of ideas and values, must have been very personal in Arizmendiarrieta; his formulation is closely tuned to pontifical texts at all times.[^ch1-52] It is interesting here to underscore, first and foremost, the eminently moral and religious, not analytical, character of this vision.[^ch1-53] The following text from Pius XI could serve as a good summary of Arizmendiarrieta's thought as expressed in his first texts: "Humanity, regrettably, moved away from God and from Jesus Christ. This is why it has come to fall from the previous state of happiness into this abyss of evils, and this is why all the attempts made to repair the evils and save the remains of so many ruins frequently fail. God and Jesus Christ have been excluded from legislation and government, the source of authority has been put in man, not in God; because of this, laws have lost the guarantee of true and imperishable sanctions, and have stayed detached from the sovereign principles of the law, whose unique source, according to the pagan philosophers themselves, such as, for example, Cicero, was the eternal law of God. The fundamentals of authority have disappeared, because of the suppression of the fundamental reason for the right of the ruler to rule and the obligation of the governed to obey. The inescapable consequence was the cataclysm of all human society, lacking any base or solid defense, and made into a prison of political actors who struggle for power, seeking their own interests, not the interests of the homeland."[^ch1-54]

According to this (theological) vision of history, all evils—wars, revolutions, injustices and social disorder—come from mankind having distanced itself from God. More concretely, social injustices that, according to Pius XII, "cry to heaven" with their gravity, have the following "causes":

[^ch1-52]: In Pontifical doctrine, this vision has formed part of their fierce opposition to the modern liberal or democratic world until very recently. Such reactionary aspects are not lacking in Arizmendiarrieta's thinking, either, in his early years. This is why an explicit acceptance of democracy is not found in Arizmendiarrieta until Pius XII's Christmas radio message of 1944; "freedoms" generally will be judged negatively, and he will insist that the Church is indifferent to any political regime; he longs for the religious unity and solidity of medieval principles, even though, on the other hand—doubtlessly due to Maritain's influence—he approves of the death of "that Christianity." In all this, Arizmendiarrieta will experience a radical evolution.

>- marginalization of religion in public and social life, which is thus deprived of firm principles,[^ch1-55] with the consequent moral deterioration.[^ch1-56] All other causes must be understood as an explanation of this one.
>
>- the violence unleashed by "modern freedoms," that have "divided nations into two classes of citizens."[^ch1-57] With the ancient guilds now dissolved, and the order that kept the weakest protected now broken, "the times senselessly handed the solitary and defenseless workers over to the inhumanity of business owners and the unbridled greed of competitors."[^ch1-58]
>
>- individualism or "individualist liberalism"[^ch1-59] and, additionally,
>
>- selfishness, "which orders and subjects everything to its exclusive benefit, completely ignoring or infringing on the good of the rest."[^ch1-60]
>
>- greed, usury, avarice, etc., that have become universally accepted in the liberal economic order, being practiced with all honorableness "under a different appearance."[^ch1-61]

It should be added that moral corruption, the ultimate root of social conflicts in the Pontiffical analysis, is not exclusive to the dominant classes: it has also taken over the working classes, causing struggle without quarter between classes. Pius XI expressed it in what has become a celebrated phrase: "From the factories, inert material comes out ennobled, but men are corrupted and are made more vile."[^ch1-62] In a society with corrupted leaders, the corruption of the subjects seems a condition of self-defense and survival: "the leaders of the economy," says the Pontiff himself, "following a path so deviated from righteousness, it was natural that workers would wander *en masse* into the same abyss."[^ch1-63] We underscore, finally, that since Leo XIII (*Quoad Apostolici*), the so-called "social doctrine" of the Church[^ch1-64] has tended to reduce liberalism and socialism (or communism) to identical common causes.[^ch1-65]

The two World Wars appeared in this perspective as the best evidence that a social order is not possible while disregarding God, which is to say, "the natural and traditional basis of society."[^ch1-66] "The present troubles," Pius XII declared on the eve of the Second World War, "are the most impressive argument for Christianity, as there cannot be a greater one. From the gigantic vortex of errors and antichristian movements, such bitter fruits have been harvested, that they constitute a condemnation whose efficacy overcomes all theoretical refutation."[^ch1-67]

This was the first source of Arizmendiarrieta's thought. Today's reader, who is probably somewhat surprised by what we have discussed, also needs to be able to situate it in the atmosphere in which it had its origin. During the first half of the twentieth century, all Western thought, on the left or right, is dominated by the feeling of bankruptcy, from O. Spengler, who believes the sinking of the West is unstoppable, to the last Scheler, Klages, Ortega y Gasset, for whom it is rationalism that has entirely failed in the face of life, and even the Marxists and Personalist thinkers, for those whom liberal civilization has definitively entered into the phase of violent self-destruction, or the existentialists, not to mention the so-called "conservative revolutionaries," more or less neighbors of fascism. Among these thinkers, it will be the Personalists, as has been said, those who will have the most influence on Arizmendiarrieta's thinking. But this general atmosphere was also reflected in the Church, including the Spanish Church. Following the short triumphalist parenthesis, in which doubts seemed no have place, the end of the Second World War brought the old issues back to light. That something was failing miserably in Western culture was unquestionable: two consecutive world wars demanded an explanation that reached the root of evil.

With the conflict over, *Ecclesia* wondered, between the victors and the vanquished, who was truly bankrupt. "Christianity has not failed," it responded, "but rather the negation of Christianity." Arizmendiarrieta gives the same response. No, there cannot be peace without God.[^ch1-68] And, more concretely, without God, there cannot be social peace. As Pius XII declared in his message to Spanish workers: "without the Church, the social question is unsolvable."[^ch1-69]

[^ch1-67]: Pius XII. *Summi Pontificatus*, 20 October 1939. In all these ideas—social disasters as a result of moral decay, wars as a result of sin, chaos originates from the abandonment of God, etc.—Arizmendiarrieta is immersed in a broad theological tradition which, through St. Augustine (cf. Pegueroles, J., *El pensamiento filosófico de San Agustín*, Labor, Barcelona 1972, 110-111) connects with Deuteronomic and prophetic thought in the Old Testament (cf. Von Rad, G., *Theologie des Alten Testaments*, vol. 1, Ch. Kaiser, Munich 1969, 346 ff., 395 ff.), even though it is necessary to recognize that "crime and punishment" connection certainly overflows the margins of confessions. However, these aspects do not constitute more than an introduction to Arizmendiarrieta's own thought. Our interest is, first and foremost, in that they illuminate the genesis of Arizmendiarrieta's thought, in which the ethical foundation will prove to be decisive.

[^ch1-68]: "Where Christ does not reign, there is constant war," we read in Buomberger, F., *La crisis de nuestra cultura y las leyes eternas*, Biblioteca de Promoción Social, Cádiz, 1942, 20. Arizmendiarrieta used this book extensively in his discussions of the current crisis. Various literary references (Montesquieu, p. 10; Dupanloup, p. 21, etc.) could likewise come from the cited study.

Point by point, as we have been able to verify, the young Arizmendiarrieta adheres, in the topics he deals with, to the Pontifical teachings, well equipped with quotes.

Beyond what we have said, this also constituted, at least on the more explosive issues, a whole method to prevent possible censorship and reprisals. Years later, at the time of the Vatican II and of John XXIII, we still see social apostles who faced situations under a dictatorship, armed with pontifical quotes. In Arizmendiarrieta's writings, the massive use of pontifical texts disappears almost entirely by the late '40s. But until then, it was also very frequent for him to raise social demands or harshly criticize injustices based on Christian social doctrine. It is, without a doubt, the same tactic which can be seen today in some countries, where criticism of "real socialism" seeks support in texts by Karl Marx.

However, Christian social doctrine will soon seem insufficient to him, and, above all, "too scholastic" and abstract. It must come down, he says later, from the Olympus of ideals to the "vulgarity" of real facts.[^ch1-70]

In this descent, he seems to have needed other help more urgently than Christian social doctrine.

### Personalist roots: Maritain

The authors with the most works in Arizmendiarrieta's library are Ortega y Gasset and Maritain.

A direct influence of Ortega y Gasset on Arizmendiarrieta's thinking does not seem to be detectable, unless it is a very vague and generic influence. It is instructive in this respect to observe which passages Arizmendiarrieta underlined in Ortega's texts in his reading[^ch1-71]: they are precisely the ones that seem to coincide with Arizmendiarrieta's very characteristic vision of the open man, creator of himself through action, through invention. To limit ourselves to a single example, in the book *Meditation on Technique*, the following text is underlined: "In the hole that overcoming his animal life leaves, man takes on a series of nonbiological chores, which are not imposed on him by nature, which he himself invents. And precisely that invented life, invented as a novel or a work of theater is invented, is what man calls human life, well-being,"[^ch1-72] At the end of the book, we again find this passage underlined: "But human life is not just a struggle with the material, but also man's struggle with his soul."[^ch1-73] These are classic Arizmendian thoughts.

[^ch1-69]: Pius XII, Address to Spanish workers, 11 March 1951, DS/BAC, 1098.

[^ch1-70]: Letter from 8 November, 1974 A.D. José María Setién (Arizmendiarrieta Archive).

[^ch1-71]: It must be observed that the library, in this sense, cannot be an exhaustive reference for us. Arizmendiarrieta knows and cites in his writings works that are lacking today in his library (for example, Ortega's *La rebelión de las masas* is missing, and the same thing is said of important works by Maritain). Still, a detailed study of underlined passages in Arizmendiarrieta's books could be illuminating.

We said in the conclusion of the previous section that Christian social doctrine ended up seeming too distant from reality to Arizmendiarrieta (similarly, he would counterpose, in 1945, real Marxists and book Marxism, cf. CAS, 18). We wish to transfer here one last text of Ortega, strongly underlined by Arizmendiarrieta in pencil:

>"It is proper for the intellectual who is close to things to manage them; material things, if he is a physicist, human things if he is a historian. If the German historians of the nineteenth century had been more political men, or even more "men of the world," perhaps history would today be a science, and together with it, a really effective technique would exist to act on large collective phenomena, before which, it is said with shame, modern man is like Paleolithic man before the lightning bolt.
>
>The so-called 'spirit' is a too-ethereal power, which gets lost in the maze of itself, of its own infinite possibilities. It is too easy to think! The mind, in its flights, finds little if any resistance. Therefore, it is as important for the intellectual to experience material objectives and learn, in his dealings with them, a discipline of content. The bodies have been the teachers of the spirit, as the centaur Chiron was the teacher of the Greeks. Without things that are seen and touched, the presumed 'spirit' would be no more than dementia. The body is the gendarme and the pedagogue of the spirit.
>
>(...) All the creators of the new science realized their consubstantiality through technique. So it was with Bacon and Galileo, Gilbert and Descartes, Huygens and Hooke or Newton."[^ch1-74]

Ortega, still without seeking a confrontation with the regime, was far from being the master of thought who wanted Francoism in the 40s.[^ch1-75]

The teachers consecrated in the new "Spanish science" were, rather, Donoso Cortés, Menéndez y Pelayo, Balmes, the latter even with the express recommendation of Pius XII[^ch1-76] and the support of *Ecclesia*, voice of the Spanish Ecclesiastical Hierarchy.[^ch1-77] On the contrary, the same magazine had not hesitated to severely criticize Ortega's thought.[^ch1-78] And, in 1946, censorship would expunge some writings considered inappropriate (i.e., republican) from the edition of his *Complete Works*. "Just the sound of the name of Ortega y Gasset after the war, amplified by demagogic claims, brought very dangerous resonances of separatism, picaresque, individualist "me-ism," in the spirits of the Spanish and in the homeland itself."[^ch1-79] The mere fact of such a (relatively) numerous presence of the works of Ortega y Gasset in Arizmendiarrieta's library is significant. Indeed, the topic awaits a more detailed analysis.

The influence of the Personalists turns out to be very palpable and concrete throughout all of Arizmendiarrieta's work, especially that of Maritain and Mounier. Because Arizmendiarrieta is an essentially Personalist thinker, we will have to return to this topic consecutively in the various chapters. Here, we will limit ourselves to the question that concerns us: the perception of the crisis of Western culture.

Remember the first chapter of Maritain's *Humanismo integral*, which discusses "the tragedy of humanism."[^ch1-80] The description of the crisis Arizmendiarrieta has given us, though without the clarity and brilliance of the original, continues to be a faithful echo of Maritain's analysis.

Alongside the Supreme Pontiffs' "theology of history" and as a complement to it, Maritain could represent for us a "Christian philosophy of history,"[^ch1-81] which was very characteristic of that era wracked by the crisis. The dissolution of the Middle Ages and of its sacral forms, writes Maritain, has given way to a profane civilization, which has separated itself progressively from the Incarnation: from the worship of man-God, it moves to the worship of mankind, worship of the pure man. Maritain characterizes the spirit born of the Renaissance and the Reformation as the spirit of the "anthropocentric rehabilitation of creation." We have a perceptible symbol of this process in the transition from Roman or Gothic art to Baroque.[^ch1-82]

After analyzing the various stages of this process, Maritain shows how the very dialectics of anthropocentric humanism, of faith that "man himself is the center of man," has led to this tragedy of humanism, to "inhuman humanism."[^ch1-83] To be able to properly understand it, it must be observed that, for Maritain, as for Arizmendiarrieta, the transcendent dimension belongs essentially to all humanism. This dimension should be understood in the most general sense of self-improvement, transfiguration of modern man, aspiration to a superior reality of transformed human nature, which can be understood, for example, to include the aspiration to the Marxist new man, not only the Christian new man. In this sense, the heroic element would constitute a basic element of all humanism. To offer man what is purely human as an aspiration, says Maritain with Aristotle, "is to betray man and to desire his disgrace, because, by the greatest part of him, which is the spirit, man is called to something better than a purely human life."[^ch1-84] Humanism, he continues, "essentially tends to make man more truly human, and to manifest his original grandeur by making him participate in everything in nature and in history that can enrich him ("concentrating the world in man" as Scheler approximately said, and "expanding man to the world"); it demands, at the same time, that man develop the potentialities contained in himself, his creative force and life of reason, and to work to make the forces of the physical world instruments of his freedom."[^ch1-85]

So, then, the tragedy of humanism (the three tragedies of man, of culture, and of God) begins when, with the pretension of radical humanism, it was desired to dispense with all transcendental reference, "enclosing" man, essentially open by nature, in himself. At the dawn of the modern era, rationalism, first with Descartes and then with Rousseau and Kant, forged an image of the human personality, haughty and splendid, unbreakable, jealous of its eminence and of its autonomy and, finally, essentially good. Every external instance was excluded, whether this was an instance of revelation or of grace, of tradition, of any law of which man himself was not the promulgator, of a sovereign Good that asks for his will, even of an exterior objective reality to measure and regulate his intelligence. But in little more than a century, observes Maritain, "this proud anthropocentric personality has died out, has collapsed rapidly, dragged into the dispersion of its elemental materials."[^ch1-86] First Darwin and then Freud showed that man, so highly deified, is no more, in the deepest part of his being and of his origin, than "the fatal movement of polymorphic larvae of the subterranean world of instinct and of desire (...), and that all the beautifully rendered dignity of our personal consciousness appears as a deceitful mask."[^ch1-87] The person appears as a battlefield on which blind forces face each other in conflict—the libido and the instinct of death. Man, wanting to pass himself off as an angel, appears as a monster.

This process of rapid decomposition of anthropocentric humanism has not prevented us, confesses Maritain, from continuing to claim human sovereignty with more energy than ever. Except, this no longer lies in the individual human person, but rather in the collective (State, nation, race, class).[^ch1-88]

Alongside this tragedy of man—we hope that in the preceding ideas, their close relationship with Arizmendiarrieta's thought could be recognized without difficulty—the tragedy of culture has developed, which we will outline briefly. At first, there was an attempt to set up human order based on reason alone (16th-17th centuries, the classical period). After that, an awareness developed that a culture that intends to separate itself from supernatural norms should take sides against them: this, then, is about freeing man from every religious "superstition" and of assuring the human spirit earthly well-being (18th-19th centuries, the bourgeois period). The twentieth century represents the third stage, the revolutionary stage, in which man, being no longer able to bear the machine of this world, starts a desperate war to make an entirely new humanity emerge from radical atheism.[^ch1-89]

Maritain, in the middle of the war, blamed this for "the current disintegration of family life, the crisis of morality and rupture between religion and life, and in the end (...), the crisis of the state and of civil conscience and the need for democratic states to be reconstructed according to a renewed ideal."[^ch1-90] He also warns of the need to "cure reason, disintegrated by a collective delirium and by the racist and Nazi cancer."[^ch1-91]

"Our need and our crucial problem," he writes, "is to return to find the natural faith of reason in the truth."[^ch1-92] But, he underscored, above all, the need the West has to renew itself in its sources of Christian inspiration: "(...) If the present agony of the world is, first of all, in my opinion, the sign of a supreme crisis of the Christian spirit, which, for so long, was forgotten and betrayed in the democracies, and against which political totalitarianism emerged as a definitive threat, it is obvious that a renewal of the Christian conscience and a new work of evangelism will be the primary and incontestable conditions of this undertaking of moral re-education that man in our civilization so badly needs."[^ch1-93]

Always moving within these schemas of interpretation, the early Arizmendiarrieta understands the crisis that has already exploded in two world wars, not as a circumstantial or partial crisis (economic, for example), but as the crisis of the very fundamentals of a civilization, with all its principles and values, which, beginning by deifying man, has ended up consecrating the slavery of man by man, or his nullification in the collectivist ocean. Removing from the heart of man, says Arizmendiarrieta, that feeling of fear of a God who rules or governs the world with his laws means man ends up rushing into the abyss and roasting on the fire that he himself has caused. "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him," he exclaims with Voltaire (SS. II, 211).[^ch1-94]

## B) Sociological view of the crisis

At the beginning of 1941, two priests were simultaneously sent to Mondragon: D. José Luis Iñarra, as parson, and D. José María Arizmendiarrieta, recently ordained as a priest, as curate.

J.M. Mendizábal recounts it this way: "The then Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Vitoria told *don* José Luis that he had to go to Mondragon. *Don* José Luis put up some objections—among others, that he was not an expert in social issues, and Mondragon was a working class town. Mons. Lauzurica reassured him, telling him that he would send him a recently ordained priest who knew about that. This was *don* José María."[^ch1-95]

However, the first field of activity assigned to Arizmendiarrieta was youth, not workers.[^ch1-96] He then expanded his parochial activity into other fields: parents, etc. Only little by little did he enter the social field. Arizmendiarrieta's first writings centered directly and fully on social matters are after 1945. These writings—conferences, notes—show a view of the crisis that is quite different from the one just discussed, even though the general purpose continues to be the same in both: the creation of a new social order in correspondence with the Christian vision of life.

[^ch1-94]: The studies we find in Arizmendiarrieta on the assessment of the person in paganism and in Christianity could have their origin in Mounier, who made use of this comparison on several occasions. For a brief history the notion of person and of the personal condition, cf. Mounier, E., *Le Personnalisme*, P.U.F., Paris 1950, 8-14.

## Historical observations

Just as we did in part A, we will begin with a historical introduction, which allows us to better understand the evolutionary process of Arizmendiarrieta's thought.

### War wounds

Father José María Llanos, director of the Diocesean Secretariat of Exercises in Madrid in the years 1942-1952, conclusively describes the spirit of the militant Catholicism of that time: "'For the empire, towards God.' For the Exercises towards..., an anti-Maritainian and closed Christianity."[^ch1-97] Maritain basically did not fit in the system. His translations were primarily published in Buenos Aires. A young Maritainian or Mounierist priest in the middle of the period of the 40s is noteworthy.

However, that will surely seem less surprising, if we consider Arizmendiarrieta's surroundings. It proves, in fact, that Arizmendiarrieta also falls within what has come to be called "the case of the Basque cleric."

It looks like Arizmendiarrieta came to know Mounier's thought by the time of his studies in the Seminary of Vitoria.[^ch1-98] The same thing can be presumed about Maritain, with somewhat greater probability. Whatever the case, we are inclined to think that the influence of these thinkers in Arizmendiarrieta begins to really take on importance in the late '40s and early '50s.

Maritain, Mounier and the French Personalist movement were already well-known in Euskadi before the war. The Christian Basque social movement, then at its vigorous peak, held them in high esteem.[^ch1-99] However, the renown of these authors would reach their high point when, in the civil war, reviled by their own Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, slandered, scorned and excommunicated by the Spanish hierarchy,[^ch1-100] and despised by the Vatican, Basque nationalists find in them the only defenders of their cause in a Catholic world entirely favorable to Franco.[^ch1-101] "In that climate of hatred and fanaticism," writes the priest Pius Montoya, "of misunderstanding and loneliness that we found ourselves in, the help from the few Catholic intellectuals who raised their voices in our favor is doubly remarkable: Mauriac, Bernanos, Cardinal Verdier, Bishop Mathieu, and above all, Maritain, are names who we can never forget."[^ch1-102] Maritain, especially would be covered with merit for participating actively, going from words to deeds on the committee for aid to exiled Basques, as vice-president of the "Ligue Internationale des Amis des Basques."[^ch1-103]

[^ch1-97]: Llanos, P.J.M. *Cursos de cristianismo acelerado. Ejercicios espirituales, Hechos y Dichos*. Nr. 465, 1975, 40-43.

[^ch1-98]: Larrañaga, J., *Don José María Arizmendi-Arrieta y la experiencia cooperativa de Mondragón*, Caja Popular, 1981, 38. All in all, a professor of Arizmendiarrieta's who was a disciple of Mounier in a rigorously academic sense seems unlikely; more likely, he would have been a studious follower of his ideas.

[^ch1-99]: Tusell, J., *Historia de la Democracia cristiana en España*, Cuadernos para el Diálogo, Madrid 1974, vol. II, 95 and 115. That, in Tusell's opinion, "would be enough to prove the falsity of a statement, which does not become any less inaccurate through repetition: that Basque nationalism was, from the theoretical point of view, something entrenched in the past. On the contrary, the nationalists were in contact with the most modern Catholic thought of the times" (95). Since the second half of 1934, in *Euzkadi* magazine, where a section entitled "Social labor" already existed, "there also appeared a periodic section entitled Esprit Nouveau Basque, very related, as its name indicates, to French and Belgian publications of the times. This section had a markedly youthful, democratic and social tone; in it subjects of undeniable relevance for the moment were dealt with: the Christian value of democracy, the Christian revolution, and the desire to make the proletariat disappear through access to property" (89-90).

Because of its intellectual prestige and its influence on Catholic media all over the world, the Spanish right wing found Maritain's position scandalous, since, from the beginning, he had defined himself clearly against "the myth of holy war," considering it an "Islamization of the religious conscience," which could have no other effect than the multiplication of sacrileges on all sides.[^ch1-104] Contrary to the feeling of the Spanish Catholic hierarchy, Maritain judged the Spanish Civil War as a dishonor for Europe, and the pretension of holy war as insulting to God.[^ch1-105] If it is a sacrilege, he replied, to kill and destroy what has been consecrated to God, temples and priests, it is no less sacrilege to kill and destroy that which God most loves, the poor, even if they were "Marxists."[^ch1-106] And if it is a sacrilege to drop bombs on the temple of Pilar, it is a much greater sacrilege to bomb defenseless civilian populations like Guernica and Durango.[^ch1-107] "Kill yourself," he declared, "if you believe you must kill yourself in the name of the social order or of the nation (...); do not kill yourself in the name of Christ the King, who is not a warlord, but rather a King of grace and of charity, who died for all men."[^ch1-108]

[^ch1-102]: Montoya, P., in: Ibarzabal, E., *50 Años de nacionalismo vasco 1928-1978*, Ed. Basque, Bilbao 1978, 48. "Jacques Maritain, relates P. Montoya, was totally identified with our cause and defended us with special zeal. As all we know, it was his foreword to the book *Aux origines d'une tragedie de Mendizabal*, that caused such disturbance in international Catholic media and disapproval among the Spanish—Father Pérez de Urbel described it as Maritenian "heresy"—the cause for which Franco demanded from Gomá that the Spanish Bishops define their position on the conflict, which they did, obediently, in the sadly famous Pastoral Letter of July first, 1937, undersigned by all the Bishops, with the exception, naturally, of Vidal i Barraquer and Mateo Múgica."

Arizmendiarrieta was unable to access these texts from Maritain in their day, since they were being published in *Euzko Deya* around the same dates that, in Bilbao, his sentence was handed down in a summary trial. But it is difficult to imagine that he did not learn of them quite soon. They have to do, at any rate, with Arizmendiarrieta's first "case," that we know of, in Mondragon.

In his preaching, Arizmendiarrieta referred frequently to war in general, but never directly to the Spanish Civil War. However, a statement of his that every war has materialist motives, an affirmation that dates back at least to Plato (Resp., II, 14, nn. 373 ff.), provoked the irate protest of a parishioner, convinced that "Spain's war was made to safeguard Catholic Christian civilization."[^ch1-109] After enumerating the crimes of the "reds" and proving abundantly, with texts from Lenin and with quotes from the Pontiffs and from the Spanish hierarchy, that the civil war was, in fact, a holy Crusade, he concluded the protest: "And this issue being, as is it, resolved by the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR A PREACHER TO COME AND AFFIRM THE OPPOSITE. That is to scandalize souls, as, in fact, it has scandalized us. Yesterday, I did not hear him, but I received commissions protesting the way that he did so (...). Reflect. You found a people in peace. Let them not come to us to divide us with these things, because I know that after the sermon, groups are formed, some very happy because the preacher has sided with them, and others, in contrast, outraged by what they have heard."

Only two months later, the following (handwritten) letter was sent Arizmendiarrieta, as the head of Catholic Action, from the Delegate[^ch1-110] of the Traditionalist Spanish Falange and of the JONS in Mondragon:

> Mr. *don* José María Arizmendi-Arrieta
>
> Present
>
> My dear sir: For days, I have observed that the portrait of the Ex-captives for God and for Spain has disappeared from our Catholic Spanish Action Center. Was it perhaps due to forgetfulness that it does not occupy its place, which should be distinguished after the Sacred Heart, the Roman Pontiff, and our Generalissimo Franco?
>
> I expect that your righteous conscience will be able to correct this deficiency and even return it to the place which it previously occupied to avoid my Hierarchical superior finding out.
>
> May God keep Spain always, and you many years.

[^ch1-109]: Letter from X.X. (we omit the name for obvious reasons) to Mr. *don* José Luis Iñarra (Parish priest) of 30 March, 1942. Arizmendiarrieta Archive. It also seems that this time, Arizmendiarrieta had expressed himself in sufficiently general terms: "In Saturday's sermon," says the letter, "the preacher made this statement: (I will attempt to employ the same words) 'all wars, the one now and those before, national and international, all of them have been made because of materialist selfishness.' This was the concrete affirmation. So, then, it can clearly be seen that as he poses it, he also referred to our recent national war, since he made no exceptions. What's more, that with his repeated word ALL, he clearly demonstrated that he also included our war." That this has sufficed to provoke such a reaction in a person vested in a high rank in the villa can give an idea of the hypersensitivity that reigned in Mondragon after the war.

[^ch1-110]: Letter from X.X. (we omit the name) of 22 May, 1942. Arizmendiarrieta Archive.

Arizmendiarrieta, after some consultations with his ecclesiastical superiors, did not admit said portrait back into the Center.

These anecdotes have no other value than to remind us of the tense post-war environment. They indicate to us that it is necessary to know how to read between the lines and, above all, pay attention to that which, in Arizmendiarrieta's writings, goes unmentioned or is simply suggested, no less than to what is said. All this also gives us cause to remember the principles by which Arizmendiarrieta wanted see the Catholic Action Center ruled, as he himself discussed the first of June of 1941, upon taking charge of the Center. This Worker Center had been converted, after the occupation, into a political circle; it was taken from the owner group, with no compensation, to become the Catholic Action Center, for the sufficient reason, as the bill of return informs us, that the group had made no economic contribution to the cause of the National Uprising. Arizmendiarrieta's text, while rather extensive, is interesting because it announces to us, at an early date, the major topics that will be constant in his work.

> As the first to rise to speak, it falls to me to justify our presence in this locale, which has a history of 38 years, with a rather troubled history, like that of this town of Mondragon, because, being located, as it was, in the center of town, it has been unable to remove itself from political and social upheavals, despite having been established to shelter in its rooms those who were of a mind to live far from politics, which always divides, shrinks, and embitters the heart.
>
> (...) Born in those years in which the seed sown by some social apostles was beginning to bear fruit, it was called the Worker Center. The social Encyclicals of Leo XIII had come to saturate the environment of the times with social concerns, and after the first phase of sincere enthusiasm, and after the first firm and decisive steps, the enemy began, like always, to sow the seeds of discord and division, so that while Leo XIII was still alive, dissidence and schisms begin, and in his encyclical *Graves de Communi*, published the 18th of January, 1901, he directs a vibrant appeal to Catholics to embrace the bonds of charity and form—abstaining from matters that divide and offend—a common front against social extremists, whose ranks they are joining, and against the tentacles of the liberal bourgeoisie. "Reality demands, and demands vehemently," says Leo XIII, verbatim, in this encyclical, saying that courage and unity are necessary, "as immense misfortune looms and fearful disasters threaten..." And here in Mondragon, in which the Marxist virus had already penetrated, and above all, ruthless liberalism had put down deep roots in the hearts of many leaders and businesspeople, this Center was created, which, without a focus on unions, struggled for social demands and has fomented the spirit of unity and brotherhood among the Catholics of this villa. This is why it is deduced from reading their early rules that, in the mind of the founders, some of which are present here, this Center was meant to be a social home of the people of Mondragon, in which, in the warmth of the Catholic ideal, it sought to bring together all Catholics and focus them in a tight beam to face both those who exploited the scattered working masses, and those who tried to sow in them, terrain prepared by misery and pain, those social ideas which then showed such a great increase. The objective of this Center was to bring Catholics together more and more, to face common enemies. The idea of the unity and brotherhood of the workers of Mondragon was what induced its founders to create the organization that was called the Worker Center of Mondragon" (PR, I, 15-16).

The objective that Arizmendiarrieta proposes to himself and proposes for the former Worker Center, now the Catholic Action Center, is to create a "spirit of brotherhood and unity," so that peace can be effective in a new order. First, the unity of Catholic workers: Catholic Action is called, in his opinion, "to carry out this magnum opus of world regeneration, creating, in the bosom of society, cores of Christians who, closely united by the bonds of charity and of mutual love, are foci that radiate Christ with their example and with their exemplary life, who, like the early Christian communities, make those who see us exclaim, "the whole multitude of the faithful has one heart and one soul'" (PR, I, 18). Then the unity of all workers, and of all people, employers and workers, will dissipate hatred and resentment, which cover the Mondragon sky with black clouds, says Arizmendiarrieta, foreshadowing new storms (Ib. 16). This is also the mission of the priest, who must act to "cure and heal the wounds opened by hatred and rancor, wounds which, if not healed, can end up infecting the whole social body with gangrene" (Ib. 17).

This is not vain, pious rhetoric. Mondragon had been harshly punished by social struggles and by the civil war.

During the Republic, social instability leads to frequent clashes, both between employers and workers, and between workers of different unions. Employers and upper management of businesses can no longer be seen except with bodyguards.[^ch1-111] In an order that was more apparent than real, left and right prepare among the shadows for the assault on power. The militant socialists of Mondragon receive instructions on the handling of weapons and explosives. Since the crisis of '29, all eyes are on the Russian Revolution. The wait is long and tense. The weak bourgeois democracy cannot be consolidated, but neither does it collapse on its own. Crises occur. October third, 1934, Alcalá Zamora entrusts Lerroux with the formation of a new government. This calls the CEDA to power. Immediately, the Left declares a general strike. At dusk on the fourth, the Mondragon socialists rise up in arms: following a long-prepared plan, in a few hours, they occupy the town, take the most important personalities prisoner, and take control of the situation. They fail in the attempt to burn the barracks. But, apart from in Asturias and some industrial centers of Euskadi, the revolution has not been supported. The Mondragon socialists feel isolated. Unfortunately, blood has run: a worker is shot dead. He is a Carlist [*a royalist*]. Some revolutionaries, seeing that their operation has failed, end up hastily killing detainees Marcelino Oreja and Dagoberto Resusta, both prominent personalities in the province.[^ch1-112]

[^ch1-111]: Larrañaga, J., op. cit., 64, I. Chacón, head of the Unión Cerrajera, describes the old Mondragon as "a hard town, it was, and one of the most brutal. I remember my walks with bodyguards, the street fights and endless upheavals in the period before the civil war" (conversation with Larrañaga).

In '36, the Right rebels. The occupying troops enter Mondragon the 26th of September. Their actions would be horrific. The excellent description y J. Larrañaga excuses us from stopping to describe the terror endured by this locksmithing town.[^ch1-113] We will only note that in the large number of people shot in Mondragon for God and for Spain are three priests: Archpriest and parson *don* José Joaquín Arin and coadjuncts *don* José Markiegi and *don* Leonardo Guridi.[^ch1-114]

It was more than a defeat. In Mondragon, and in all Euskadi, the drama of the "holy war" would continue tormenting Basque Catholics, who were among the vanquished. Neither as a former *gudari* [*Basque soldier*], nor as a Maritainian priest, could Arizmendiarrieta accept that it had been a war "to safeguard Catholic Christian civilization." But this opinion was official doctrine, both for the Church and for the State, with logical consequences for a man of public responsibilities.

In post-war Mondragon, the reconciling work of a priest could not have been at all easy. Years later, we still continue to hear the echoes of that conflict. But it is not our task to go into this topic (we only intend to situate Arizmendiarrieta's thought in its context). We will transcribe, to finish this topic in all its breadth, a writ of protest from 1949, directed by "Catholic workers" of Mondragon to the religious magazine *Surge*, of Vitoria:

> Director of *SURGE*
>
> Dear Sir:
>
> All wars are bad, but the most repugnant is the civil war, the war between brothers, and after 12 years, the sores from that cursed war remain unhealed, and religious magazines, rather than seek a cure, work to irritate them, many times lacking the truth. The most painful part is that we speak of a magazine of the Diocese of Vitoria.
>
>"*SURGE*," the monthly priestly magazine of Guidelines of the Apostolate, no. 63, of September of 1949, in its chronicle "Switzerland in black and white" by Casimiro Sanchez Aliseda (?) recounts the following dialogue with a Dutch Father, a missionary in Chile.
>
> The missionary Father: "You see, little fathers, my Prelate needs priests. I have orders from him to look for them in Europe, and primarily in Spain, where they already have the advantage of the language."
>
> Mr. Sanchez answers him: "But reflect. In our diocese, more than four hundred reds were shot. And in all Spain, the dead would be ten thousand. And that is in the diocese in the North of the peninsula...."

When Arizmendiarrieta talks to us about overcoming hatred and resentment, about reconciliation, about overcoming the antipathy of Left and Right, about collaboration between employer and workers, he is certainly not speaking in general, abstract postulates. He speaks as a former *gudari* and a priest of Mondragon, and speaks for Mondragon, with a very concrete experience behind him and a clear objective before his eyes: it is neccesary give this old world up for dead, which has cost so much blood and hatred, to build a new order of dignity and concord.

### 1945: Change

The victory of the Allies also meant, indirectly, a defeat for the official Spanish Church, which had celebrated the triumphs of Franco's troops from city to city, and multiplied penitential religious events: "'the pains of the world,' a call to Catholic Action tells us, 'and the threats against the homeland demand that we live by the spirit of the Church: Lenten slogan of prayer and penitence.'"[^ch1-116]

Pla y Deniel, in his pastoral letter of the 8th of May of 1945, on the occasion of the end of the war, was pressured to declare that the Church is neutral and apolitical, not beholden to any side in the conflict. As Rodriguez de Coro observes, Catholic Action also felt the need to declared itself apolitical, and priestly retreats likewise ended declaring the priest apolitical. "Every bit a distancing of the Church from Francoism," according to this author.[^ch1-117] It should be added that it was about simple prudential measures, more than a real distancing. At any rate, the system of assurances built in the comfortable interior of the fascist State has been broken. "The reading," comments F. Urbina, "of the reflection of the Church's public life that is the magazine *Ecclesia* allows us to discover a change of style in religious demonstrations and in the attitude of the leaders, coinciding with the defeat of the Axis Powers and the end of WWII. The fascist political context, in which national-Catholicism found comfort—not without its contradictions—crumbles. Later, towards the end of the decade, economic infrastructural determinations will begin to turn in the direction of a decisive social change. But, at the end of the '40s, the change of the political context in Europe creates a vacuum in what had been a stable situation where new questions, intellectual self-criticism and pastoral renewal movements will be located. A change begins of in the life of the Spanish Church which, over time, will reveal its depth and complexity."[^ch1-118]

[^ch1-117]: Rodriguez de Coro, F., *Colonización política del catolicismo*, CAP, San Sebastián 1979, 388. "Nor has there been, nor is there, servitude towards anyone on the part of the Spanish ecclesiastical hierarchy," declared Pla y Deniel, "much less has it defended nor does it defend a statist or totalitarian conception. We have always defended the non-involvement of the Church in any political regime." See Arbeloa, V.M., *Aquella España católica*, Ed. Sígueme, Salamanca 1975, 231-286.

The final defeat was already foreseeable. The triumphalist euphoria gave way to anguish, to the recognition of error, to meditation. In the vacuum that appeared, criticism of Nazism began to be possible in the pages of *Ecclesia* itself. Professor Sánchez Agesta, in his reflections on the person as the beginning and end of every social order, contrasts Nazi racism and its doctrine of "national spirit" with the Personalist doctrine of Pius XII.[^ch1-119] Communism itself seems to no longer absolutely lack any positive significance. It continues to be the black beast, naturally (it could hardly be Pius XII who would give reason to think otherwise), but in December of 1944, *Ecclesia* surprises us with the recognition that communism is not pure evil, but rather responds to a real fact: social injustice. And he arrives at this conclusion: "the solely political suppression of communism, without countermeasures of social revolution, is an inoffensive distraction for the communists and tragic for the suppressors."

The words of Pius XII in the Christmas radio message of 1944, invoking democracy, will at first find little echo in *Ecclesia*, always so willing to laud the Papal message; and very dubious attitudes in the rest of the ecclesiastic press.[^ch1-120] The Spanish Church still lives immersed in the spirit of the Crusade. However, those words would mean, in opinion of F. Urbina, the "beginning of liberation."[^ch1-121]

The first affected by the German capitulation on the 8th of May was evidently the State that had emerged with Nazi help: Max Gallo has described this moment as "the black night" of Franco's regime.[^ch1-122] In spite of the difficulties, the opposition remains hopeful: "the day of the capitulation," writes M. Gallo, "the news broke around three in the afternoon. In groups of resisters, the news is telephoned from one to other. The streets empty out, Falangists are afraid. Immediate action is spoken of by the opposition, by the Allies. In Bilbao and in San Sebastian, Basques go into action, they confront the Civil Guard and, without weapons, are soon arrested, scattered, beaten."[^ch1-123] Euskadi does not give up.

These are difficult days for the regime. The June 19th conference of Saint Francis rejects a proposal by Mexico for Spain's entry into the future United Nations. On the 30th, Panama breaks its relations with Spain. The 7th of July, Labour triumphs in England, and Major Attlee, who had visited the republican zone during the Civil War, is named Prime Minister.[^ch1-124] The Big Three Conference, in Potsdam from July 17 to August 2, adopts rigorous measures with respect to Spain.

Franco was able react to this siege with unquestionable skill, giving his regime a facade of Constitutional and democratic appearance: July 13, the *Fuero de los Españoles* [*the Charter of the Spanish*] is promulgated; the 17th, he proclaims amnesty; the 21st, he forms a new government, decisively substituting Lequerica in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Martín Artajo, a man who was tightly linked to the Church and especially to Herrera Oria.[^ch1-125] Leaving the Falangists aside, Franco seeks his principle support in the Church. The 28th of August, Cardinal Primado publishes a pastoral letter, once more legitimizing Franco's regime. The Church thus assumes, from Toledo and from the Vatican, the function of "main defensive line" of Francoism against the Allies.[^ch1-126] Without a doubt, the official Spanish Church sees its own survival in intimate connection with the regime's possibilities for survival.

Thus we see, within the two Spains, the reappearance of the two Churches. Indeed, the population, 17% of which is illiterate, lives in misery and ignorance. Spain remains essentially an agrarian nation of landlords and small landowners or *braceros*, who begin to emigrate *en masse* to the cities. Working conditions are terrible: workdays of ten and twelve hours, insufficient wages, unemployment. Easy wealth, on the one hand, for black marketeers, entrepreneurial adventurers and old-time capitalists; hunger and misery, on the other hand, for a helpless population. It is understandable that, in this situation, the social question is first posed in terms of scandalous inequalities of fortune, of wealth and extreme poverty, such as we find in Pildain, Herrera Oria, and also in Arizmendiarrieta's first social writings. Abundant labor makes any protest impossible. The unions are replaced with a single, vertical union, and representative workers' organizations that can demand their rights do not exist. With all other paths closed off and penalized, these would appear in the form of Catholics workers' movements, with the HOAC in 1946, and the JOC in 1947.[^ch1-127]

[^ch1-124]: Immediately, texts of writers and laborist politicians begin to appear in Arizmendiarrieta's writings (among others, Attlee's book, *Toward a New Social Structure*, is quoted CAS 82). In the closing speech of the 1945-1946 course, Arizmendiarrieta quotes the British Prime Minister together with Pope Pius XI, taking as his own the following terms from the educational and social program of the former: "laborists believe in the abolition of social classes and in the creation of an egalitarian society. They advocate, accordingly, to give the same opportunities to everyone in education. They will abolish class distinctions which, for the most part, are born of differences in education, and will build a common educational fund as unifying factor in the community" (EP, I, 46). "The object of education," we read below, "is personality development." The equality of educational opportunities will be based not just in reasons of the humanitarian and personal sort, but rather, first and foremost, on social and communal reasons: "the nation needs the service of all citizens. Today, it fails to take advantage of the enormous quantity of good material that is wasted because of the lack of opportunity for cultural formation" (Ib. 47). As we will have occasion to see, these ideas of Attlee's will also be fundamental in Arizmendiarrieta's thinking.

[^ch1-126]: Gallo, M., op. cit., 184. "Fortunately," said Pla y Deniel, "the *Fuero de los Españoles*, approved by the Courts (...) and enacted by the Chief of State, marks an orientation of Christian freedom, opposed to statist totalitarianism," cf. *Ecclesia*, Nr. 217, 8 September 1945.

The first protests, angry in tone, arrive from the Canary Islands, where Mons. Pildain Zapiain, son of Lezo, publishes, beginning in September of 1944 and going through 1945, papers from social conferences held by himself (Lent of 1943), in Las Palmas and Puerto de la Luz, in the form of pastoral letters.

More than in his doctrine, the importance of these interventions of Mons. Pildain lies, without a doubt, in having described reality as it simply was, and in having emerged like a forlorn cry among the chorus of adulatory and triumphalist ideologues. The most disconcerting thing, perhaps, was that Pildain's pastoral letters, written in a bitter, prophetic tone, were a criticism of the Church and of the officially Christian state, made from within, and from conservative positions. Pildain condemned the situation of worker unemployment, the insufficiency of wages, horrendous prices, the ruin of families, the extent of tuberculosis and hunger, and the greed of supposedly Catholic employers. Pildain came to recognize that the strength of communism rests on three truths: the desire to improve the lot of the workers, putting an end to the abuses of the liberal economy, and achieving a fair distribution of wealth. In contrast, the weakness of Christianity lies in possessing a beautiful social doctrine, which neither the supposedly Christian State nor employers want to see put into practice. He declared all the following prisoners of communism: the State, which wastes millions of its budget without remembering its responsibility to God and to society; Catholic employers and industrialists, who oppose the workers' movement (which comes recommended by the Popes), abuse the right to property, and confuse charity and alms with the duties of justice; the Catholic press, always afraid to hurt politicians and plutocrats; Catholic Action itself, if it did not end up understanding its mission of social apostolate.[^ch1-128]

The impact was enormous. *Ecclesia* dedicates editorials to commenting on them, and in this magazine, a series of articles will run which, beginning shyly, will deal ever more decisively with social topics. Herrera Oria himself will recognize the social question as one of the bleeding problems that require a decisive and rapid response, attacking the conservative positions of those who "cling to erroneous old ideas, to historical social positions, which are in all ways indefensible today, with irrational and vehement stubbornness, like a child who tries to hold in his hands a toy that does not belong to him."[^ch1-129]

[^ch1-127]: Urbina, F., op. cit., 55.

[^ch1-128]: Arizmendiarrieta read and commented on these pastoral letters from Mons. Pildain in the parish of Mondragon for four consecutive Sundays, cf. SS, II, 306 ff.; the texts of Mons. Pildain are found in the Arizmendiarrieta Archive, see Bibliography.

"If, in 1945," comments Rodríguez de Coro, "insistence on the social topic seems to gain strength, it is possible that this is due to the end of the war and the consequences in Europe of the socialist triumphs. It was neccesary, at least at an expedient level, to disarticulate any complaint of disconsolation in the exercise of this matter, under penalty of lending a certain consent the 'harakiri' of the government itself. The communist threat was there, and a mental antidote had to be found to continue meditating with hope."[^ch1-130]

With the war over, the pastoral letter from Cardinal Suhard, archbishop of Paris, on the Christian concept of property, clearly signified the direction the Church in Europe was going to take. The war has ended, the Cardinal of Paris said: the task of every Christian now consists of putting an end to social injustice, without which there will be no true peace. The Church, he underscored, defends the right to property for everyone, not only for a few: it judges the excesses of accumulation, because the reason for the right to property to exist is as a guarantee of personal freedom and dignity; it demands, for this reason, a profound social reform.[^ch1-131]

Finally, a controversy was going to make manifest the growing distance between the two Churches. This controversy was going to be led by professor Gregorio R. de Yurre, considered at all times by Arizmendiarrieta as his teacher and friend, and one of the thinkers that, undoubtedly, most influenced his thought. Yurre had summarized in *Ecclesia* the resolutions of the Social Week of Toulouse (1946), which referred primarily to the opposition between capital and labor in a capitalist business, condemning the principle of the primacy of capital, and declaring benefit to be the "product of labor by means of capital placed at its disposal." The capitalist thus lost his position above the business, and became integrated into the "community of labor." The reaction arrived in the magazine *Mission* (8 December 1946), accusing such conclusions of socializing and being contrary to the social doctrine of the Popes. "Peleón qualified Yurre, overflowing with science, which came from his recent years in Rome, and clarified the question, chiseling a magnificent article that was crafted with the best quotes of the Popes. Yurre, a brilliant scholar—he would be a perpetual student—even mischievous and dapper, though ecclesiastical, could oppose Mr. Ortiz with resourcefulness on these topics, on which he was a specialist. Toulouse's conclusions: business reform, limitation of property, nationalization or socialization... agreed with the Church's social doctrine, which is why the writer in *Mission*, having been confronted with these principles, proclaimed by Leo XIII and ratified by the *Anno Quadragesimo* of Pius XI, being directed to the President of these social weeks, talked to him about "structural reform," and the "development of the notions of property and enterprise."[^ch1-132]

[^ch1-129]: *Ecclesia*, 6 January 1945, 18. For a broader discussion, cf. Rodriguez de Coro, F., op. cit., 218-230. There is, in these reflections, from Pildain to the articles in *Ecclesia* and to Mons. Herrera Oria, two aspects that must be highlighted for our purpose. In the first place, all these authors show themselves to sympathetic to State intervention in the case of employers who lack the necessary Christian social consciousness; Arizmendiarrieta shows a rather suspicious attitude towards the State: the solution must come not from the State, but from the workers themselves. Secondly, in the face of the reigning patriotism, *Ecclesia* raises social demands, such as demands for authentic patriotism. "(...) It is fitting to wonder if they can feel patriotic toward a State that demands even the blood of those whose situation makes the exercise of virtues and the comprehension of the values of the spirit impossible. This is why the most effective way to fulfill patriotic duties is the defense against internal enemies, against hunger, against misery, against despair, against the sickness or sterility of families, against the infinite and overwhelming series of evils that derive from unemployment and insufficient salaries." The opposition between false political patriotism and authentic social patriotism, born in this Spanish context, will have its repercussions on Arizmendiarrieta's thinking.

[^ch1-130]: Rodriguez de Coro, F., op. cit., 248.

[^ch1-131]: *Ecclesia*, 19 May of 1945, 443: cf. Rodriguez de Coro, F., op. cit., 230-232. The overlap between Arizmendiarrieta's thought and these ideas of Cardinal Suhard, basic in classical Christian social doctrine and repeated insistently by Pius XII starting in 1942, is not enough to prove that Arizmendiarrieta had knowledge of that pastoral letter. But that seems presumable.

And so, we arrive at Arizmendiarrieta's first writings on purely social topics and destined to the promotion of the social movement: conferences, notes, sermons, studies[^ch1-133] starting in 1945, in the context just described. The great crisis is understood around the social question; the social question is centered on the problem of property.

## Concerning property

It has already been indicated that Arizmendiarrieta had a very acute consciousness of living at a crucial point in history. "Probably the history of mankind has seen no stage more agitated than ours" (CAS, 53; cf. SS, II, 158). Generally, Arizmendiarrieta generously tends to understand this turbulent "stage" as the 19th and 20th centuries, including all the Modern Era, covering, beyond the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment and rationalism. But, unquestionably, he considers the two world wars as the culminating moments of the odyssey. In relation, especially, to the Second World War, he says: "this agitation and unrest characteristic of our historical age have increased in this last military conflagration and with the post-war difficulties" (CAS, 53). Indeed, the social ills that are considered the causes of war have not been eliminated or overcome with the defeat of fascism. On the contrary, the world has been divided into two blocs, the communist and the so-called democratic. But, more profoundly than by borders between States or between systems, mankind is intimately divided on its basic attitudes.

[^ch1-132]: Rodriguez de Coro, F., op. cit., 243-244 (the text appears to contain some printing errata; it was obviously Pius XII who addressed the president of the Social Week of Toulouse, cf. *Ecclesia*, Nr. 283). Arizmendiarrieta refers in various places in his writings around 1945-1950 to these articles G.R. de Yurre, cf. CAS 48, 83, 93, 100, 115-116.

[^ch1-133]: They have been mostly collected in the volume CAS (Conferences of Social Apostolate) of his *Complete Works*; see also SS, II, PR, I and EP, I.

There are two kinds of social actors that prevail, says Arizmendiarrieta: the conservatives, on the one hand, people of peace, as is vulgarly but commonly said, who are satisfied with the current state; and the revolutionaries, on the other hand, unhappy with the current situation, particularly with the current distribution of wealth. "It is commonly said that the former always tend to look back and find the foundations of their ideas and the basis of their privileges in history and in past life. The latter look at the present or to the future and demand their rights, the rights that their reason and their consciousness proclaim" (Ib.). This very distinction itself is clear enough to see where Arizmendiarrieta's sympathies and preferences lie.

Although not the only one, the central point on which the spirits are divided and the two positions are defined most categorically is that of property (Ib.). This is, therefore, the cardinal point on which the question of the establishment of a more just social order is decided: "A social economic order made to fit man. There currently exists a social economic order, but not made to fit mankind, but rather made to fit the measure imposed by a false concept of property" (Ib. 54).

Two forces are in conflict, and Arizmendiarrieta makes an effort to define his doctrine as a third way: these are liberalism, or capitalism, which considers the right to property an absolute and sacred natural right, and collectivism, or communism, which considers it unnatural. Arizmendiarrieta considers property a relative, conditioned and limited natural right; or, as he says, a right of functional character.

### Historical meaning of property

To show the relativity of the concept of property and of its value, Arizmendiarrieta begins a historical review. The historical origin, he tells us, cannot be determined precisely. The first data we have on property assumes societies that are already highly developed and organized, with their kings, landowners, slaves, etc. Even societies that are considered primitive or savage have forms of organizing that are relatively advanced, including a certain system of property. Some undergo a slow evolution which would go from a primitive communism towards economic specialization or property. But this thesis, whose main inspiration is a deterministic evolution, cannot be confirmed with sufficient data (Ib. 55-56).

However, Arizmendiarrieta follows an outline of historical evolution, according to which, in a primitive civilization in which the population lived in caves and fed on wild fruits, the ownership of houses and lands would be of no interest. Likewise, nomadic societies would not seek lands to own, but rather sites on which to graze their cattle. "Stable ownership or possession is presented linked to the development of forms of sociability," he tells us. "The more culture expands, the more grazing of animals is practiced, and the better provisioned men are with the means of subsistence, the more ownership is sought, and the more the right to it is respected. The more intensive culture becomes, the more individualized property becomes, whether in a person or in a community" (Ib. 56).

Arizmendiarrieta distinguishes four stages or phases of evolution: (1) patriarchal property, (2) feudal, (3) manorial and (4) the individualist or "quiritary" [*citizenship-based*] property regime. The idea of a right to property conferred upon the head of a people or tribe comes from the original idea that the head, as such, the patriarch or king, has a right over all the goods of the group. The oldest ancestor concentrates all rights, prerogatives and powers, including property, in his hands. Then the feudal property regime appears, in which property belongs to the lord, and is occupied by the servant, who has to satisfy certain rents in kind or money, and can be replaced by the lord. Later, the manorial, or hereditary lease, regime emerges, in which full ownership of the land is divided into two distinct rights: the right of the owner, which is a sort of mortgage credit, and the right of the landlord, which is like a hereditary usufruct. Finally, the individualist regime is characterized by the division and distribution of the land, each part of which is personal property of an individual, who has the absolute right to enjoy it exclusively, to receive all its fruits, and to dispose of it. In Arizmendiarrieta's discussion, these are not four forms of property, but four successive stages (Ib.).

The outline discussed does not include "common property" in a strict sense in any of the four periods, nor prior to them. Indeed, "we cannot say that history offers us an evolution of any kind of common property," says Arizmendiarrieta, "in which the soil or the land is a collective good or property of the State, which turns over its enjoyment to private persons, to individual ownership" (Ib. 56-57). Arizmendiarrieta believes, rather, that common and private property occur always simultaneously (not successively), both following a varied and simultaneous development, in accordance with the demands of the economy, of coexistence, of the technical progress, and of historical events. At times, one kind has predominated over the other, and within each kind, there have also been different modalities, according to the conditions of each people or historical age.

Arizmendiarrieta does not try to give us a rigorous historical discussion of the evolution of the regime of property. What he is after in his discussion is the relativization of the current forms of property, which are considered "a natural right," when they are really no more than concrete and variable forms of it. Ownership is recognized as a natural right, but the property regime does not have an immutable character (Ib. 57), and does not offer a unique legitimate concretion (Ib. 59), but rather is, and will continue to be, subjected to transformations. Drawing on Carbonell (Ib. 58-59), Arizmendiarrieta illustrates this relative character with a comparison between the principle of authority and that of property. "In the same way that the nature of man demands existence of society without setting the form and conditions of its concrete existence, which are determined by various contingent facts, and just as the nature of political society requires a supreme authority, without establishing or indicating the concrete form or the subject that should embody it—which are fixed by various facts—the nature of man and of the family demands the existence of property, which is also determined and concretized by various circumstances and historical conditions" (Ib. 59). The principle of authority is more fundamental and essential to human social nature than that of property: if the former is, in the end, variable according to the conveniences and historical circumstances, such that the form of authority materializes and transforms ceaselessly through history, the principle of property cannot be said to be any more fixed.

Arizmendiarrieta also indicates the ultimate reason for this variability: material goods have no value in themselves, but rather in relation to man. Their essential fate consists of meeting the needs of each and every one, so their legitimacy is subject to the fulfillment of this end and to the measure in which they fulfill it. Let us underscore that the end of material goods is not defined as meeting the needs or demands of their possessor, but the needs "of each and every one" (Ib. 57), with which, if not in a temporary and historical order, then in a moral order, a certain communism or common property is declared as the original order.

### Social meaning of property

If we continue to ask why material goods must be at the service "of each and every one," rather than of their possessor, Arizmendiarrieta brings us to what, for him, constitutes the ultimate foundation of human dignity: God, the creator of man, and creator, likewise, of nature. Nature, indeed, was not created for one man or another, but for man in general, for each and every one.

Among Arizmendiarrieta's arguments in favor of (private) property, those of convenience and those of need can be distinguished. Convenience would be reasons such as: property stimulates work, more production, the best satisfaction of needs; property is the guarantee of social peace, etc. (CAS, 61-62). Need would be those derived more or less directly from a demand of human nature itself. But even here, it is fitting to distinguish degrees: Judeo-Christian doctrine of the characteristic relationships between man and the universe, at most, expresses that man has the right to provide for his needs to the extent necessary, availing himself for this of the goods that God has created and placed at his disposal in nature. A concrete right to property is not easy to extract from there, though it is always fitting to say that private property is the most natural way to attend to the fair distribution of the goods that nature, created by God for man, offers us (Ib. 62). It could be argued, at most, that certain abusive forms of property, which prevent the worst-off from having access to created and needed material goods, are incompatible with this doctrine. It would, therefore, have a negative and limiting application, more than positive, to the basis of the right to property.

In fact, Arizmendiarrieta makes more use of an argument situated on the line between need and convenience, though he formulates it as need: private property is indirectly required in this case by human nature, as an inescapable requirement of individual freedom, "because freedom does not exist there where there exists dependence, dependence on another to eat one's daily bread, dependence on another to own oneself" (SS, II, 277). In this perspective, property appears as "essential to safeguard freedom and human dignity" (CAS, 95). At the same time, its validity is limited to "the extent to which it safeguards the dignity of the human person, their freedom, their initiative, and serves the development and cultivation of their human values" (Ib. 62).

There is a curious argument in favor of private property from Leo XIII (Ib. 60-61), which Arizmendiarrieta has developed in his own way: it is derived from the specific nature of man as an intelligent being. "(...) Keep in mind that for man, gifted with intelligence and capable of foreseeing the needs of tomorrow, and with a heart to feel what is foreseen, these needs are permanent needs, and because of this, he needs a permanent and invariable possession of goods; their use is not enough" (SS, II, 277). Ownership is a requirement of the human gift of foresight.

In summary, an "honest sufficiency of goods" is considered a natural right, as a safeguard of freedom and of the dignity of man (Ib. 276); as a stimulus of work and of initiatives necessary for the realization of the person: "how many talents go to waste, and how many virtues go undeveloped, because often, man does not have the most basic resources that his capacity and his intelligence demand, because he lacks everything, and is obliged to live on a paltry salary" (Ib. 279). The natural right to property, thus understood, "is not that which must benefit holders of large amounts of capital, but rather that with which must benefit all mankind; it is that with which must redeem the proletariat" (Ib. 277).

It is understandable that nearly all of Arizmendiarrieta's reflections on property are oriented towards showing, more than its character as a natural right, the relative nature of property, since the currently dominant concept is considered wrong and false, and at the same time, "taboo" by the antonomasia of our civilization (CAS, 54). "I will not say that the right to property is negligible, but to be acceptable, it should be defined and reduced to just and natural forms" (Ib.). A long labor of education and change of mentality is required: "Today, by the imposition of the environment in which we have been brought up and educated, we have an internal resistence to receiving the true doctrine on property" (Ib. 55).

Arizmendiarrieta summarizes the righteous (Christian) doctrine on property in this way:

>1. "In view of pontifical doctrine on private property, we cannot continue conceiving of it as an absolute right, as an end in itself, and as a primary principle of natural law. We must not confuse the right to private property with the right to a sufficiency of material goods to live a decent life. The absolute right is to the sufficiency of these goods, to their use, whose denial is a violation of a primary natural right. The right to private property is nothing more than a derivation of this principle, and is valid as long as it leads to that end (Pontifical Texts of the 1.4.).
>
>    The regime of private property that deprives or prevents a large number of men from having the goods needed to lead an honest and dignified life cannot defend itself by invoking a natural right to private property. The Pope says so expressly. Let us remember the condemnation of that social order that publicly denies and practically makes impossible the exercise of the natural and primary right of every man to use the goods of the land. This is how the sentence of St. Augustine is understood, when he said, "the superfluous goods of the rich are necessary goods for the poor. Those who possess superfluous goods possess the goods of others" (Pontifical Texts of the 5.13.).
>
>2. Due to the functional nature of property and the dynamic character of society, no single form of private property fulfills the demands of natural law. On the contrary, a form of property that, under certain conditions, satisfies its function can impede the purpose of property in a different environment. Those who think that there exists something divinely and immutably ordained should remember the phrase of Saint Thomas Aquinas: "Human convention, more than natural law, makes the division of property survive." Or another from Pius XII: "Every man has ... the natural right and fundamental to the use of material goods ... it being ... up to human will and to the legal form of the people to more precisely regulate practical action." The institution of private property has to be transformed to the extent necessary to carry out the ends it is assigned" (CAS, 77-79).

### The current property regime

"The right to private property is an undisputed and sacred right. And precisely because it is considered such for some, for a minority, there exists an immense, disinherited and hopeless majority that cannot aspire to have anything" (CAS, 78). Currently, an absolutist concept of the right to property dominates, "in the sense that, whatever it contains or encompasses can be disposed of however one wants, or very nearly." And any other concept of it hardly enters our minds. "And because it starts from an absolutist concept of property, with no sense of violating our conscience, funds or wealth are used, and are invested, and are administered. Concretely, in our current case, we find that capital, or its representation, could hardly conceive of that which exceeds the limit of a determined and limited benefit being wealth and money and funds which could be provided to public funds" (SS, II, 310-311).

This concept of property has led to an absurd situation. It is affirmed, on the one hand, that the current system social is based on respect for the right to property. So, if we examine the reality of constitutions and codes of law, all of them consecrate and sanction the principle of private property. "But let us go to our urban centers, and walk among their shops, their industries, their banks, and let us see whose they are. Let us study the social conditions of their debtors, let us review the statistics on the distribution of wealth. And we will see that one of the most dramatic features of our society is the great number of the disinherited, and we will observe that nine tenths of the workers work their whole lives without hope of possessing property, since it is impossible in the economic conditions of current society. The savings they can scrape together are no more than a small reserve in the expectation of a misfortune, or some other unforeseen setback" (CAS, 64).

In our society, work as the origin and source of property has been eliminated. Originally, Arizmendiarrieta tells us, it was possible to acquire property in two ways: by occupation and by work. Today, with the concepts of worker and owner divorced, and work degraded, this has been eliminated practically as a means or medium of acquiring property (Ib. 60). "Stable ownership is conceived of as the right of a class, which could achieve it either through conquest and strength, or, normally, through inheritance, purchase, gift, or other similar means. This is how the property regime of our time emerged, a regime that has been guaranteed by a legal structure and which benefits a minority, a privileged group, and which, as we have indicated, has been established by traditions and laws inspired or created more for small interests than by postulates of the common good" (Ib.).

While it can be affirmed, in general, that our society is based on a false concept of the right to property, from the point of view of human relations, two categories of private property should be distinguished, which are no different in their effects. In the first category are goods for use and personal enjoyment, such as a house, furniture, pictures, etc. and goods of ordinary consumption. The possession of these goods does not affect the mutual relationships of individuals or, at most, to a minimal degree, or in a way that does not compromise human dignity, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion (Ib. 65). This is not the case with the second category of goods, productive goods, which are not limited to personal use: "The ownership of these goods affects human relations very deeply, since, in fact, it establishes relationships of dependence and subordination, dependence or subordination that naturally influence the life of one's neighbor" (Ib.). It is the possession of these goods in the second category that provokes, when understood wrongly, the extreme reactions that can be summarized in Proudhon's expression, "property is theft" (Ib. 55). In fact, it requires the immense majority to live perpetually in a state of new slavery, which Arizmendiarrieta considers not much better than the old one (SS, I, 126), or to a perpetual state of being a minor. "Only a few, a very small class, currently enjoys private property broadly enough to feel supported by it. This class squanders money, and as soon as it can, stops providing active services to the community (which is why property is an incentive for laziness). In other times, some workers could feel attracted by the possibility of becoming bosses, but today, this is becoming impossible, because to be able to act with odds of certain success in industry or commerce requires large amounts of capital" (CAS, 64-65).

If property is legitimized by the services it provides, which is to say, as a guarantee of freedom and human dignity, the current property regime not only fails this requirement, but is, itself, the greatest obstacle to its fulfillment. "Current society is based on the fact that the majority of the population can never acquire enough private property to gain broad freedom of action" (Ib. 65). Because of all this, while Proudhon's phrase that equates property and robbery is not acceptable in its totality, it continues to express a piece of the truth. "It is necessary to remove all the truth it contains," says Arizmendiarrieta, quoting a famous sermon by Ketteler, "for it to one day be a lie." As long as it contains the smallest bit of truth, it will have enough strength to radically unsettle the order of this world. As deep calls to deep, a crime against nature likewise calls another crime. From the false right to property, communism was born" (Ib. 55).[^ch1-134]

"The current distribution of goods (...) is in conflict with the most basic postulates of equity and of justice" (SS, II, 295).

### Approaches to property

[^ch1-134]: Iserloh, E.-Stoll, Ch.: *Bischof Ketteler in seinen Schriften*, Matthias-Grünewald, Mainz, 1977, 38.

The issue refers, in principle, exclusively to the ownership of productive assets, because of the danger that this private possession implies for human relations. On one occasion, Arizmendiarrieta distinguished three basic attitudes (CAS, 66): liberal, collectivist and Church doctrine, but later, he ran into difficulties, especially in distinguishing some forms of "collectivism" from Church doctrine. Without binding ourselves strictly to the above-mentioned scheme, let us look at the various forms that Arizmendiarrieta considers in the problem of private ownership of productive assets.

#### Christian Liberalism

[*Translator's note: as a reminder, "liberalism" in this book does not refer to progressivism, but classical liberalism, which is to say, rationalism and unfettered capitalism.*]

This is what we will call—Arizmendiarrieta speaks of "Christian liberals"—the posture that consists of "holding harmless and unquestionable the right to the possession of the same (production goods), to remove risk through the penetration of Christian ideals or justice in human relations, such that it is overcome through the good will of the individual. The right to property is a sacred right, and applies equally exerted over one kind of goods or another. The right to property is so basic to economic life that it cannot be altered or replaced" (Ib. 66).

Arizmendiarrieta recognizes that this attitude was very common among Christians in the nineteenth century, and that, even in the twentieth century, it is turning out to be difficult to put another concept of property in people's minds. However, Arizmendiarrieta judges this attitude to be unacceptable: "The history of social life of the past century, and even of ours, is testimony to what can be achieved for social justice and the conditions of life of the proletarians on the unique and exclusive path of the penetration of ideas" (Ib.).

Generally, Arizmendiarrieta expressed himself on liberalism in very harsh terms, considering it the principle cause of all the evils besetting mankind. Beyond his opinions or doctrinal evaluations, his personal experience does not seem to be at all separate from this harshness. More than once in his writings, Arizmendiarrieta referred to people who, whenever workers' rights or a possible property reform is mentioned, put their hands to their heads, are horrified, and call anyone who does so "white communists" and instigators of disorder. "Today, those people are staunch defenders of the right to property, of that ridiculous right, of that right, by all appearances, that is only needed by those who possess everything that want. That right, which they dare to call natural, which they say nature has given to man. That right, which gives them full freedom to have everything they can hoard, but which they tolerate and consent to the rest being denied. That right whose exercise they want impede in others" (SS, II, 295). These expressions must have sounded harsh, coming from a priest and from the pulpit of the locksmithing town, in the postwar years.

#### The way of State intervention

"In fact, the development of right of ownership of goods of this class (of production) has meant all kinds of abuses and the inequitable exploitation of the majority of the people, which, at last, has resulted in State intervention to regulate these relationships through its laws" (CAS, 66). According to this second option, the State should regulate the conditions of the employer and workers, of landowners and tenants, to avoid abuses in the excercise of the aforementioned right to property.

Arizmendiarrieta defends the role of the vigilant State: "The State should protect individuals, and particularly the economically weakest, the proletarians, against what we recognize as the danger or inevitable temptation of exploitation or unworthy subordination that can be created by the private possession of this kind of goods" (Ib.).

But nor would it be enough to entrust the solution to the problem exclusively to State intervention; there must be, just as Christian liberals propose, a large simultaneous effort so that Christian ideals and justice penetrate into the economic world. Arizmendiarrieta does not develop or make more explicit how he would like to see this (limited, concrete) State intervention into social matters understood.

#### "Socialism"

The opposing forces on this topic generally have, in Arizmendiarrieta's first writings, the three-part model, with two opposing poles (liberalism and collectivism), both of which are unacceptable, and Christian social doctrine as the third and solely valid option. Liberals reject outright any notion of redistribution of goods, or even of the limitation or relativization of property: property is sacred. At the other extreme, blind and deaf to any consideration, with the inspiration, says Arizmendiarrieta, of their instincts and violent reactions, the collectivists want abolish all property (SS, II, 295). This model seems valid while discussing the general principles of Christian social doctrine, with a strong interest in noting that it should not be identified with any concrete formula of social ordering. The model ceases to be worth much as we come down to concrete issues.

The study *Meaning and Limits of the Right to Property*, written shortly after World War II (1948?), ends up abandoning the three-part model with which he had begun. Church doctrine no longer occupies a place of its own, but rather, there is a division between two possible options: the above-mentioned way of State intervention (to prevent abuse), and the "socialist" option, which we put in quotes, this being the first time Arizmendiarrieta's writings distinguish between socialism and "collectivism." The latter term, in turn, which had previously encompassed communism, national socialism, and fascism, will remain basically reserved for communism.

The social doctrine of the Church on the issue at hand is here reduced to very general terms: "while private property for all constitutes its ideal, it continues to recognize the need to socialize some goods, which more or less depends on the problems that their private possession creates" (CAS, 76). And he insists that this constitutes "the ideal," leaving it clear that the practice could allow for variations.

In the first place, Church doctrine is compatible with the path of regulatory State intervention, which we could consider corrected liberalism, since the State intervention is limited to the relations between employers and workers, without intervening into the actual possession of production goods. "The Church, as soon as it saw the consequences of the development of this right to ownership of productive assets, demanded the presence and intervention of the State. And its position is no doctrinal novelty, but is, rather, a function that is recognized in the State in traditional doctrine" (Ib. 67).

The question of the compatibility of ecclesiastical doctrine and socialism turns out to be more delicate. Even disregarding the reigning anticommunism, Arizmendiarrieta is obliged to confront the emphatic pronouncement by Pius XI: "No one can be a sincere Catholic and a true socialist at the same time" (*Quadragesimo anno*). Arizmendiarrieta, not wanting "to confuse labels with things," distinguishes in socialism between philosophy, on the one hand, and the program of economic reorganization, on the other. "The philosophy is not essential for the program, nor is the program a logical derivation, an inescapable conclusion, of the former. In history, there have been socialist movements, both ideological and social, that did not begin with the inspiration of that Marxist and materialist philosophy. Those who inspired contemporary socialism joined the two things, and that is what has brought conflicts between them and Catholics. The concept of the community of goods is not in the least a concept of Marxist origin. It has had its greatest sponsors among the Fathers of the Church, and even the Church is familiar with economic matters organized according to those theories" (Ib. 71). Hence, the socialist programs, as Pius XI himself will emphasize, often come surprisingly close to the just demands of Christian reformers, which is to say, "a Christian social program is found surprisingly close to the socialist" (Ib.). With materialist philosophy abandonded, "the highest socialist aspiration of avoiding economic, political and social predominance through the general socialization of production goods is satisfied in this way of focusing on and solving the problem through pontifical doctrine" (Ib. 76).

Should we conclude that, given the surprising affinity of programs, Catholics must consider socialization an ideal to which they should aspire? "This implies something else. Even today, when no one, not even the communists, defends absolute collectivism, which is why even the communists themselves are closer today to Christian doctrine and positions, the ideal remains a minimum of socialization and a greater development of private property" (Ib. 72). At this point, a new distinction is imposed, that, availing ourselves of the terms most used by Arizmendiarrieta in this study, we will designate collectivism and laborism.

#### Collectivism

Arizmendiarrieta cites three examples of collectivist societies with broad historical resonance: the ancient Egyptian and Inca societies, and modern Soviet society. With respect to the collectivist Soviet regime, he remains very cautious, "being too soon to be able to pass judgment on the results of collectivism in Russia, which, on the other hand, is a *sui géneris* collectivism, and we also do not have many impartial studies" (Ib. 74). "It would be naive," he observes anyway, "to think that Russia, out of fidelity to abstract principles, maintains systems that are clearly disadvantageous for the accomplishment of its purposes. After some practice and radical organizing experiences, it has tempered things, and, in a sense, ceded some of its radicalism. It cannot be said today that Russia continues to maintain the abolition of all private property in the least" (Ib.).

However, from the other two cases of collectivism that are discussed (we no longer have the text), identical conclusions are reached in both cases: both led invariably to the psychological annulment of the personality, from economics to spiritual life; to the loss of individual interest, to inertia and to an aversion to work, to gregariousness and intellectual dullness; on the other hand, it reinforced officialdom, bureaucracy, etc. Arizmendiarrieta concludes that, in general terms, collectivism is autocratic, "economic Napoleonism," as Saint-Simon, father of socialism and of the planned economy, foresaw with all clarity (Ib. 74-75).

#### Laborism

Arizmendiarrieta's sympathies at this time (1945-1950) are clearly for laborism. Among the different modalities of socialism, this faction is presented as "perhaps the most mature and strongest" (CAS, 68). Neither in its program nor in its philosophy is there anything repugnant to Christian doctrine or sensibility. "What's more, today we have a collective declaration from the English episcopate in which it is expressly recognized that [Catholics] can belong to said party" (Ib. 72). Indeed, Arizmendiarrieta tells us, Catholics who adhere to socialism are more numerous every day.

The evaluation that laborism makes of private property seems to Arizmendiarrieta to be lucid and thorough. We can summarize it in the following items: (1) the individual requires private property, through which to be able express him/herself; it is neccesary to possess something to possess oneself. (2) Socialism is not a set of dogmas, but rather an idea, which must be carried out through a series of experimental changes: these must be carried out keeping in mind that property is a medium of expression of the personality, with no pretense of abolishing it, therefore. (3) Private property can be subjected to limitations, considering that socialism, in its moral aspect, represents a medium for the achievment of true individual liberty and, in its economic aspect, is a system that wants put an end to exploitation. "It is not easy," Arizmendiarrieta comments, "to address the issue with more consideration and common sense. Neither could one adopt, with a minimum of fidelity to theoretical principles, a more reasonable and discreet position. There is no doubt that this is characteristic of the English, and of the Labour Party" (Ib. 69).

Between intervention by the regulatory and vigilant State, to prevent abuses derived from private ownership of productive goods, and the socializing State, which intervenes directly in property itself, Arizmendiarrieta seems to lean, with the laborists, towards the second formula, even though in principle both are compatible with Christian social doctrine. State intervention cannot be trusted to be able to, in fact, avoid abuses "until the arrogance and predominance of the individuals who have powerful means of production in their hands is most radically destroyed" (Ib. 69).

#### Years of vacillation

I explain as "vacillations" some inconsistencies or indecision observed in Arizmendiarrieta between the years 1945 and 1955, approximately. Already in 1944, a writing warns us that the social programs of "the so-called communists" contain more Christian doctrine than many party platforms that are called Catholic (SS, II, 271). But a page later, among those who strive to practice social justice, the communists or socialists and the fascists are mentioned indistinctly (Ib. 272). Arizmendiarrieta limits himself to demanding the collaboration of all men of good will, over and above ideological differences, without excluding the communists. It is a daring thesis, indeed, for 1944.

Between 1946 and 1948, a surprisingly abundant number of socialist politicians, especially laborists, suddenly appear scattered through Arizmendiarrieta's writings: J. Ramsay MacDonald (CAS, 68), S. Stafford Cripps (Ib. 69; EP, I, 48), C.R. Attlee (CAS, 70; EP, I, 46,73), Leon Blum (EP, I, 74), etc. Without a doubt, Arizmendiarrieta has discovered socialism, and feels great sympathy for it. The quotations from socialist politicians alternate with those from the Supreme Pontiffs, whose social doctrine Arizmendiarrieta tries to put into practice, even though in these years, he is largely limited to the field of education. On multiple occasions, he underscores the overlap between Christian and socialist aspirations: "Another celebrated sociologist and English ruler coincides with pontifical thought, almost to the word" (EP, I, 48); "it is a crusade in favor of education of the young workers whose urgent need is felt equally from the President of a Labour government and head of a socialist party to eminent scientists and the Pope..." (Ib. 77). We can take for granted that Arizmendiarrieta's socialist inclinations became resolved and determined in these years, but that the reconciliation of Christianity (social doctrine of the Church) and socialism was no small problem.

Among Arizmendiarrieta's vacillations at this time, in spite of his clear socialist sympathies, we can highlight two topics: the State and private property. With respect to the State, the evolution is clearly perceptible, for example, in the section on education. In his first writings, he underscores the education of children as the exclusive right and duty of parents; if the State is mentioned, it is to criticize the rights that it unjustly assumes, making itself an educator alongside parents. In 1944, with the project of the Professional School begun, this is considered an issue for parents and the community, especially businesspeople, who have particular duties towards the workers. We can still read expressions directed to the "most worthy businesspeople," like the following: "believe that, even today, a little good will, a little comprehension, a little generosity on your part can address the anxieties of the multitude around you. Those agitated mobs, those mobs poisoned by hatred, will come to recognize your generosity and good will, and that generosity and good will disarm them" (EP, I, 27). In 1946, quotes from the laborist authors begin suddenly, and both the tone and the approach change strongly: with Sir Attlee, he proposes equality of educational opportunities as a means for the abolition of social classes (Ib. 46); in the same article, he says for the first time that the obligation of providing education to youth is incumbent on the State. A year later, he criticizes the State's lack of interest in professional training (Ib. 58), a criticism that will become constant. In the following years, Arizmendiarrieta's major topics on education arise rapidly: socialization of culture, overcoming class differences, emancipation of the working class, etc., and he insists on the responsibility of the State, until in 1967, Arizmendiarrieta declares that, in principle, "the full burden of education" should fall to the State (FC, III, 40), though once more, he reminds us that it fails to meet its obligations in this field.

He started from positions that are classical in Christian social doctrine, which, where possible, try to avoid the State, if not from positions full of suspicion and distrust towards it: he insists in the primacy of conscience and personal or community initiative, where the State is called on only as a subsidiary, when lesser communities are not enough, according to the order of institutional hierarchy that has been established. Thus, Arizmendiarrieta remembers that Leo XIII, still required to allow for State intervention to prevent abuse in the relations between employers and workers, was of the opinion that, in principle, "these are relationships that those who are directly affected should regulate among themselves" (CAS, 67); for this, workers must group together. It is undesirable to need the State. All Arizmendiarrieta's thought and labor, even later, are, in fact, directed this way: the importance of consciousness training, leader creation, grassroots organizations, etc. In his thought, the State hardly ever assumes a truly active role, except occasionally and momentarily.

However, socialism, without excluding laborism, has a much more positive attitude towards the State, giving it an active and leading role in society, not just subsidiary or supportive and last-minute, when lesser institutions have seen that they not are sufficient. I am inclined to think that Arizmendiarrieta never reached a positive global view of the State, always maintaining a profound distrust towards all manner of officialism, asphyxiating bureaucracies, and absorbent States, which drown every grassroots initiative. With harsh criticism of *laissez faire* liberalism on the one hand, and distrust towards the interventionist State on the other, Arizmendiarrieta's posture seems inconsistent, even when he become convinced of the convenience of certain socializations or nationalizations. The encounter with socialism gave a new turn to many of his thoughts, but his fundamental attitude with respect to the State, suspicious and distant, prevailed. In the case of the private ownership of productive assets, he will come to accept State intervention "in substitution of the capitalist" (CAS, 69), arguing, with S. Stafford Cripps, that the community as a whole acts more justly and equitably than individuals, who have their private interests in play. But then, in concrete cases (social assistance, etc.) it is still preferred that the State not intervene except indirectly; rather, those who are affected must search for solutions on their own.

Neither his social consciousness nor his Basque consciousness seem to have inspired in him a more positive attitude towards the State, in spite of the laborist influence of 1945-1950. And least of all, without a doubt, the concrete State in which he found himself carrying out his work, as can be seen in the union question:

> We have to recognize that (the workers) have every reason to distrust our paternalism, and when I say "our," we can include the State, because for all the great concern and interest the leaders show for the proletarian classes, it will always be true that the workers in them see no more [in the leaders] than the extension of the employers, who, together with them, are getting richer, or at least allowing for a magnificent course of life. Working people need to form groups, because they know that their strength is in unity. And a natural right drives them to do it, which is largely defrauded in the channels imposed on them by a single, official organization.
>
> (...) In these conditions, it is not unusual for State unions to lack vitality and for their efficacy to be disproportionate to their cost. Such organizations are unable to obtain the sympathy of their members, and even less so their trust. The individuals feel alienated from a State organization moved by means that are uncontrollable for those who are affected. The State burdens them with heavy tasks, with all the drawbacks of being in the hands of a bureaucracy. Like other social and economic organizations, the union has the right to be autonomous, which is to say, has the right to existence and government independent of State will, to determine its own action programs and administrate its goods. The autonomy of unions from the State is at least as fair as the autonomy of businesses.
>
> This does not mean absenteeism or the indifference of the State in relationship to unions. As we have said in a previous article, the State has a domain of jurisdiction over the individuals and social entities existing within it, but not on the totality of man, nor on the totality of social beings. To claim otherwise is to fall into totalitarianism. In virtue of this power, the State should establish the legal framework in which union organizations move, as it does with economic organizations, without involving interference in their internal life. The law must free the union not only of the State monopoly, but also of any attempt by political parties to monopolize union action to their own advantage" (CAS, 186-187).

In fact, in the end, the impression is left that Arizmendiarrieta conceives of the State, apart from exceptional cases in which he accepts a more direct intervention, fundamentally as a mere builder of the "legal framework" in which social forces can carry out their activity. The only time the State is praised in all his writings, if I am not mistaken, is on the occasion of the legislation that established the family salary (CAS, 183). A few lines below, even then, he will try to prove that this legislation is absolutely deficient (Ib. 184). Distributive justice forces to the State to prevent inequalities between the parties to a contract from giving rise to abuses. Otherwise, "all measures taken by the State with respect to the problems of work have to be considered as applications of the principle of distributive justice. These may be considered the insurance of the workers against illness, unemployment, accidents, old age, etc. These are means to complete what is due to labor in relation to its social function" (Ib. 32-33).

We can now conclude this point: we have started from the idea that State intervention, for the purpose of avoiding abuse, was insufficient; but there is very little more that Arizmendiarrieta seems be willing to grant to the State.

The second point to highlight among Arizmendiarrieta's vacillations is that of private property. His first writings stress the absolute need for private property to safeguard human freedom and dignity (SS, II, 176 ff). In 1945, he continues to affirm that "all the great teachers of the social doctrine of the Church, with the Pope at the head, without denying the need for a prudent socialization of certain sources of production, see in the institution of private property an essential element to safeguard human freedom and dignity" (CAS, 95).

In the same study, *Social Action*, socialism and communism are still considered tendencies that are "identical in the end, in that they consist of transferring all rights and all duties to the State" (Ib. 99). (Let us note, in passing, that in the extensive bibliography of this study, dated in December of 1945, not a single socialist appears yet, cf. Ib. 114-116).

But the relative value of property appears more and more clearly. A moment comes in which, faithful to the Popes, Arizmendiarrieta agrees as an ideal, underscoring that it is only the ideal, to widespread private property. But Arizmendiarrieta remains hesitant, first, because of the difficulties entailed by the realization of this ideal (CAS, 75); but, beyond that, because of contact with the laborists, he has discovered that, if the concept of property is relative, the ideal of property is no less so. It is once more Mr. Attlee who makes him see that the economic and social conditions themselves, starting from the initial importance of private property, through industrial development, have come to relativize its value, such that "the old security of the individual, based on the enjoyment of private property, must yield to trust in a equitable participation of wealth produced by the community, and that individual freedom for everyone can only achieved if the restrictions imposed by collective life are accepted" (CAS, 70). Arizmendiarrieta believes he has discovered that, in fact, these tendencies are taking shape in our society, and that the worker movement itself is oriented in this direction in the most developed countries. "If we review the documents and testimonies of current proletarian aspirations, we will see that they point the same way, and they're pursuing the goal of security, disregarding property. As an example, we can quote the Philadelphia Charter, in which private property is not mentioned at all" (Ib.). The maximum distribution of private property is no longer even an ideal, after having been the resource with which Arizmendiarrieta had previously wanted to save the pontifical doctrine of the intransgressable natural right to property ... However, this difficulty will find a solution with the cooperative concept of property, which will make it possible to combine private property and socialism. But, to arrive at the concept of cooperative property years later, Arizmendiarrieta will have to define the nature of the relations that mediate, according to his thought, between property and labor.

Later, we'll have occasion to continue this evolutionary process of Arizmendiarrieta's thought, which began in 1945.

## Community and State

We have seen the hesitations of the young Arizmendiarrieta, after his encounter with laborism, on the topic of the relations between society and the State. It will be fitting to return the topic from its beginning.

Indeed, the topic places us squarely in political problems, to which Arizmendiarrieta seems to have always felt an invincible internal resistance. Starting from an initial ethical-cultural or moral concept of the crisis, which was eminently religious, Arizmendiarrieta has expanded his vision, moving, in the second half of the '40s, to a socio-economic analysis of it. But we see that there, Arizmendiarrieta stops. He does not manage to take one more step, and recognize the political crisis ensconced in that crisis, in spite of this being manifest. Here, we can demonstrate that, in Arizmendiarrieta's reflections, the political aspects will be the most neglected and least developed. On political topics, he will always appear shy.

In his first writings (1941-1945), Arizmendiarrieta conceives of the family, the State, and the Church as a institutional pyramid, wisely arranged.

To create life and respond to most intimate needs of human beings, the institution of natural right has emerged, which is the family (SS, II, 121-122).

Many human needs exceed the limits of this first institution. The same natural impulse, by the drive of the social nature of man, then gives rise to another, wider institution, civil society, which Arizmendiarrieta sometimes identifies with the State (ignoring the forms that this may take), while at other times, the State is identified with the form of government. The State as civil society provides man with those elements of progress, happiness and well-being that man alone could not provide to himself, with the resources that he has at the family level. In this spontaneous and natural way, man, obeying his instincts, becomes his own providence, for his own natural perfection, and on the path of his temporary and limited happiness (Ib. 122).

For his supernatural perfection and eternal happiness, the institution that congregates and guides mankind is the Church, which is uniquely authorized and responsible for salvation and spritual matters (Ib. 124). The three degrees require and complement each other mutually.

### State (Civil Society) and Church

Other times, referring more concretely to the relations between the Church and the State, this perfect pyramidal harmony is supplanted by the model of the two parallel and independent societies. Here, Arizmendiarrieta explains the origin of civil society, or the State: "The mother meets the needs of her baby, and for this, nature has given her everything that the child has need of in its infancy, in which it cannot be self-sufficient. Later, man, to provide himself with other things that he has need of in his life and which he cannot provide for himself, induced by the same natural instinct, has given rise to other entities, to other associations; among these institutions that were born obeying a natural impulse and to meet the materials needs of man, is civil society, is the State. In the State, the sociability of man culminates, the State is supreme society, the most perfect society of all the many that have had origin in the sociability of humanity. Man seeks his first complement in marriage, and so conjugal society is the first degree of society. But, having to confront, in turn, after constituting that society, other, broader societies, man seeks in those broader societies, whether of the professional, economic, or political type, more effective, more profound aid for his needs and problems. And the society called the State, constituted whether by men of the same race, or united by geographic or topographical homogeneity, or by the community of the destiny, or whatever it is called, sprouts from human need, and exists to serve the material prosperity of man. Its end is to serve the material prosperity of man. Its existence does not obey whim, but rather a need" (SS, II, 107-108).

In accordance with this end, the State "in everything having to do with ordering well-being or public prosperity is independent of any other authority, is perfect and sovereign its authority" (Ib. 108).

What form of State best suits mankind? Arizmendiarrieta shows himself to be extremely cautious. The State, he tells us, "can dress itself any way, whether democratic, monarchical, oligarchic, etc.; the just form of authority is that which, in each place, and in each country, and even each circumstance, best provides and promotes that public prosperity, best promotes that well-being" (Ib. 108). The choice of the best way in each case, he tells us, the Church leaves to the opinion of men: there is not one, on principle, that is most adequate in the eyes of the Church. He insists that Jesus Christ, whose life was lived in the most precarious political circumstances imaginable, refrained from political options, and observed a conduct of great respect for authority. He refused to compromise his ministry by making the subsistence of the Church incompatible with this or that form.

What Jesus Christ did, says Arizmendiarrieta, was give life to another society, the Church, with a supernatural nature and ends, "whose life, however, does not limit or compromise the life and the rights of civil society in any way" (Ib. 109). From her, and from no one else, should men receive doctrine concerning the soul, doctrine concerning all problems that transcend the material order: everything regarding the moral and spiritual order is incumbent to her.

"Two spheres, two societies with different purposes: behold, Catholic doctrine" (Ib. 110).

What must the relationship between these two societies be? Until Jesus came to the world, civil power held spiritual power, or jurisdiction spiritual, at the same time. Plato and Aristotle recognize the interest of the State as the supreme standard, even accepting (Aristotle) infanticide as legitimate, as being in order, for the good of the State; or approving of standards that intrude on private life and on the conscience of men, without any limitation, for the good of the State (referencing some of Plato's laws on family life). "These doctrines of the ancients, this way of considering the relationship of individuals to the State or society, explains very well why castes and slavery were seen among them as the most natural thing" (SS, I, 124). In Greece and Rome, "service to the State and to the common good was what gave human life content and meaning" (Ib. 110).

Jesus Christ, then, established the separation of the two orders, natural and supernatural, material and spiritual. With this, he did not want to want disturb the peace, for he came precisely to bring peace (SS, II, 110). "Jesus Christ, through the establishment of another society, could not intend to disturb public life, and had to choose a solution and a harmonic development between both powers. We see that he did not get into debates about the justice of established power. Maybe getting involved in it, he could have found a formula to extract himself from obedience to the authorities in Palestine, who, in the end, were foreigners and oppressors; but, passing over such matters, he observed a correct and respectful conduct, in this way, showing his church the path to follow, which we see, over the course of centuries and across space, has coexisted with the most diverse political and social forms. He could not impose a struggle between the powers. He, who in all, sought peace and harmony, had to desire an intelligence between both powers, as long as there was no greater obstacle" (Ib. 110-111).

The doctrine of human nature as being composed of body and soul, which should not be conceived of as two separate and independent entities, seems to have very little influence on all these explanations. Body and soul, material and spiritual (moral) needs, seem to be two perfectly separable and separate spheres. Let us recognize, finally, that both the pyramidal outline and that of the two societies rest on very classical traditional foundations, even though Arizmendiarrieta has not bothered to harmonize the two positions.

When do these texts date from? It is the question that arises immediately. Once more, we find ourselves with the difficulty that one finds with the voluminous material written of Arizmendiarrieta's that carries no date, nor can this be determined by internal criteria. We can suppose that they are from the early '40s (1941/1942?), because, first, from 1945 on, there is no lack of manifest criticism of the "absorbent" State (of which no indication is seen in the texts just discussed) and democratic demands; some texts that, though they also carry no date, can still be situated with all confidence around the time of the Second World War, likewise manifest a rather less respectful tone towards the State, which, he will now tell us, whether democratic or "collectivist" (a concept that does not appear in these texts and, instead, will be very frequent in those we assume to be from a couple of years later), invades the field of conscience, and tries to take full ownership of man, excluding the Church. Note, too, that in the cited texts, it is argued that the "community of destiny" is a possible foundation and origin of the State: texts we assume are somewhat later, but belonging to the years of the Second World War, quote that same community of destiny expressly among the collectivist "myths" of the false modern saviors.

The ideas that we just discussed may well be the immediate reflection of the education that Arizmendiarrieta received in Seminary. A certain underlying polemical tone against a "nationalist" Basque Christianity also calls that to mind (Jesus Christ did not oppose the Romans, even though they were "foreigners and oppressors"!), as well as the insistence on respect due by the Church to civil authority in any circumstance, that Jesus Christ came to bring peace, etc. In contrast, we can cite a text of Arizmendiarrieta's we assume was drafted around 1943/1944 (certainly in the middle of the Second World War): "We do not believe in the promises of those who do not respect man as a man, of those do not see in man anything more than an animal, a subject with no more mission than that of being advantageous or useful to society, nor do we believe in the Christianity of those have the name of God on their lips, but whose God is not the Christian God, who is the only sole and absolute objective of human life, God the Father, who has other children who deserve the same consideration and the same treatment... who must be respected and loved, because they are also children of God, and have the same destiny as us, the Creator and Redeemer God who has redeemed man and not the State, the Redeemer God who shed his blood for man and not for the State, the remunerative God, who must remunerate man, who is the only immortal and eternal, who has a supernatural destiny" (SS, I, 11: cf. Ib. 128, where he repeats the same expressions). Here already, Arizmendiarrieta bluntly adds that no one should believe, "as seems to often be believed, that the political order is independent of Christianity, a sphere in which Christ and his doctrine have no entry; nor should it be believed that, while the crucifix hangs on the walls, we are excused from other duties" (Ib. 127). Here, a revolutionary Christianity is demanded, free from myths of race, destiny, etc., opposed both to absorbent statism and degrading collectivism (Ib. 117), committed in the construction of a new order: "We Christians, contrary to what is assumed about us, cannot be conservative, in the sense that we should cling to those old ideas, in name of which that inhumane exploitation was possible, which has resulted in such a deep division between rich and poor; we Christians cannot be conservative, in the sense of settling for the social and economic structure of that world that does not know how to distribute well-being to the whole social world, that has been created by the constant progress of society and the effort of all; but nor we can be reformers or revolutionaries, such that we consent to the despotic domination that, so far, is exercised by the wealthy, the capitalist, a fairly anonymous person, but no less tyrannical and cruel, being exercised by what can be called State or society" (Ib. 115).

Now, and in relation precisely to modern States, it will be said that they are "created on principles that are, in themselves, corrosive, principles that lead, over the long term, to decomposition, to war, to injustice" (SS, II, 160).

### The (Spanish) State and Church

In the early '40s, the topic of the relationship between the Church and civil society or the State is one that generates many debates and much confusion, as Arizmendiarrieta recognizes (SS, II, 192). The Church is accused "of unworthy servility, on the part of some, and by others, of an absorbent ambition" (Ib.). Let us return to this topic already dealt with briefly above.

Especially in times of regime change, says Arizmendiarrieta, not having clear ideas about what the relations between the Church and the State should be provokes confusion, resistance, disappointment. "We have seen curious cases of all this in recent years in which we have been witnesses to the most diverse and strange political vicissitudes. During the Republic, suspicion against the intentions of the Church was spread by quite a numerous sector, which was addicted to doing so, because the Church was seen doing everything it could to create a perception of the Church as being with those who were ostentatious about their authority, who injured and harmed its political interests, who struggled to wrap themselves in a religious flag. Later... just the opposite happened. The very ones who had then perhaps rejoiced at this close relationship of the Church to those who were ostentatious about their authority were scandalized, perhaps too much, by the perception and the agreement between the Church and the Authorities" (Ib.).

The Church is, naturally, well above such vagaries and fulfills its commitment to obeying any civil authority punctually, seeking to maintain relationships of peace and harmony with it...

And what to say about the oath provided by the Bishops to the Chief of State? How does it fit with the principle of separation of the two powers? In principle, Arizmendiarrieta responds, no civil authority may require an oath, either of loyalty or of any other kind (nor in public trials), from any of the ecclesiastical establishment, from the lowest subdeacon to the Bishop (Ib. 37). However, in the countries that have concordats with the Holy See, the custom has spread that certain high offices provide a loyalty oath to civil power. "It is a lesser evil that the Church tolerates, which we should not think of as becoming the ideal, since, while it is an expression and a testimony of deference and even of adhesion, it is a custom that has been imposed by suspicion of the civil authority of ecclesiastical authority, out of fear that the latter will hinder the purposes of the former" (Ib. 38). The Holy See, at any rate, has had and continues to have a rule of never sacrificing the essential freedom of its hierarchs (Ib.).

The ostentatious presence of civilian authorities in ceremonies religious can be, and is for many, a reason to harshly criticize the Church, a motive to become "accidental enemies" of public worship, which they consider more political and propaganda than religious. "As anything can be exploited, we are not going to say that this has not been and is not also exploited for partisan, and therefore debatable, purposes," responds Arizmendiarrieta (...) "Those who do such things are sacrilegious, and will not have to wait long to receive punishment for their audacity and impiety, which is covered with piety. However, the participation of the authorities in these acts does not, itself, imply their desecration by any means. Those who are true authorities, or whose are least ostentatious about their authority, should participate in the name of the society they represent in these acts, and in simple participation, there is no reason to single out these acts as political maneuvers, and therefore, to be able be excused from attendance or participation" (Ib. 43-44)...

The positions that Arizmendiarrieta adopts on these matters are, to say the least, surprisingly naive, even recognizing that they belong to the period immediately following his training in Seminary. Arizmendiarrieta had also been a soldier and a prisoner of war. It seems, then, legitimate to suppose something more than fidelity to doctrine received in his training period or the simple naivety of a new priest.

From the end of the nineteenth century, coinciding with the loss of the *Fueros* and with the industrial explosion, two ideological tendencies clashed harshly in the Basque Country, and never stopped influencing the cleric, as well, mostly after the war: socialism and nationalism. These two tendencies, which can be distinguished briefly (at least in reference to the cleric) as a political current and a social current, both, in the end, of a conflictive character, have historically been irreconcilable until recent times, by the different nature of their respective claims (national, social). With very few exceptions, those who took up social demands were confronted by those who preferentially took up (national or nationalist) political demands, and vice versa. We consider it unnecessary to go any further on this topic.

On the other hand, ignoring for now the question of whether or not it has had an effective historical influence, the Church has officially proclaimed its mission as social since the nineteenth century, while, on the contrary, it has continued declaring itself, up to our day, entirely apolitical. The Church, according to this, does not intervene in politics, but does in social issues (politics, in Euskadi, has frequently been equated with nationalism). This distinction was accentuated, out of necessity, after the war: to dedicate himself to social matters became, for a priest, if not a need, at least a worthy and meritorious chore; politics ("nationalist sympathies"), on the other hand, was the most absolute taboo.

Arizmendiarrieta displayed his tendency and his sensitivity to social topics very early, a perfectly legitimate thing in the official doctrine of the Church, sanctioned by the Roman Pontiffs themselves and, in that moment, by the ruling hierarchs of the Spanish Church. All interest in political topics remained, on the contrary, prohibited by the Roman Pontiffs themselves and the hierarchs, as improper for the priest, and for the Church in general.

Let us conclude, finally, that the situation in Mondragon, politically and socially, is very divided (SS, II, 226-227). Arizmendiarrieta understood that his priestly mission consisted precisely of achieving unity, beyond political differences. He wanted to be "just a priest," taking the greatest care not to allow himself to be boxed in to any political group, an independence which he judged absolutely neccesary and essential for his priestly and unifying work, given the circumstances of the locksmithing town (PR, I, 15-20).

For various reasons, we can already conclude that Arizmendiarrieta lived his first years of priestly activity with an attitude of strong rejection of politics, that, as a consequence, meant a rejection of so-called nationalism. It can be presumed, even, that some aspects of this (racism, etc.) repelled him profoundly.

It seems, in effect, that the debates and objections around the Church, especially about the relations between the Church and State, that Arizmendiarrieta tries to clarify, came from the political (which is to say, nationalist) field, which he, a young priest, could not esteem very highly, as indicated, even though he himself had previously been an activist in that current. A detailed analysis of the objections and responses allows this conclusion to be established with sufficient solidity.

In a text like the following, trying to explain the specific, independent and apolitical mission of the Church—and some would like to see "its cause confused with the cause they defend" (SS, II, 115)—it is difficult not see clear allusions to Basque nationalism: "The true Messianic ideal degenerated and was reduced to a purely political ideal (...). But that Savior for Israel did not have to be more than a warlord who had no more mission than proclaiming the independence of his Homeland under foreign power (...) It seemed that the interests of all mankind were no more than the interests of a single people. It seemed that over and above political interests, there were no other values; it seemed that there was no other way to carry out the restoration of the order lost by sin than by proclaiming the independence of a people. It seemed that peace and the welfare of mankind were precisely linked to the eternal glory of a nation, of a people. And this was the narrow mentality of those Hebrews" (Ib. 116). However, Jesus refused to be the champion of such a cause, he disavowed it fully, resolutely opposed such a Messianic conception. The Church will likewise oppose any attempt at being politically instrumentalized. 

Let us look at one more text, this one about the relations of the Church and the State. "Regarding this, the doctrine contained in the gospel itself is sharp and clear. The example of Christ in this particular does not offer itself to misrepresentations. Christ first teaches with his example and then ratifies with his words what has already been taught. The political circumstances of Palestine in the times of Jesus Christ were the most sensitive that can be imagined. Palestine is a country that, for almost two hundred years, has been struggling for its independence (...) How strong was this national consciousness! We see it in their struggles against the Greeks and the Romans. But, at last, they fell under Roman domination which, for discreet as it was, was unbearable to them. Jesus obeys the decree of the census, or registration. He respected Roman laws (...)" (Ib. 193). Jesus complied fully with political authority, despite being the son of an oppressed and struggling nation.

And this is also, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, the history of the Church. "She has ambitions that are more generous, more humane than any *caudillo*, any party, and any system in the world. She cannot be reduced to... coordinating or subordinating those coarse, narrow, national, social or racial ambitions... and so, She must suffer and withstand being the enemy of all. For some, the fundamental value is blood, the greatest mission is to conserve the purity of that blood... making everything all else secondary to that... sacrificing everything... freedom, dignity... everything, to the purity of that blood... and when the Church says that spirit is above blood, when she recognizes that purity is fine... but more purity of the spirit, She will become their enemy. Others will say that there are exploited classes... and that currently, the first mission is their rehabilitation... that is well and good, but She will say that the happiness of the world, its well-being, does not only depend on that, and that, as a consequence, other factors must be taken into account... other rights of every human being must be taken into account... whoever they are... She will have earned their enmity" (Ib. 116-117).

Arizmendiarrieta wants, then, for the Church, a cleanly separate and independent position, over and above mundane matters, which he believes was implanted by Jesus Christ by implanting in the world the kingdom of "the unique and transcendent truth" (Ib. 118). For the moment, She appears to be above, not only political issues, but also, and no less, the different social schools.

At a point that is difficult to determine exactly, around 1944 or 1945, presumably, Arizmendiarrieta begin an evolution of his positions. On political issues, the observable changes could be described as going from indifference on systems (monarchy, oligarchy, etc.) to a demand for democracy in 1945, a change that could have been motivated by the message from Pius XII on democracy (cf. CAS, 40). His evolution was stronger in the social field. There, of the early thesis of the transcendence of the Gospel and of the Church, all that will remain is the impossibility of equipping the Church's social doctrine with a concrete social formula. Otherwise, the Church will be seen as clearly committed on social demands of all kinds. On the contrary, Arizmendiarrieta has never spoken of political demands, which can be demands for equal justice, except to ask for freedom to unionize, which also belongs to the political-social field; the need for democracy will be based, not politically, but socially.

The issue of Church-State relations can seem (and, in reality, is, when considered by itself) secondary and marginal in the aggregate of Arizmendiarrieta's thought. It is, however, of the greatest interest, if we relate it to Arizmendiarrieta's central thought: the emancipation of the working class. In the political conception of the proletarian revolution, [*the conquest of*] the State plays a decisive role. That assumes recognition, even if only passing, of the positive role played by the State in the transformation of society. Arizmendiarrieta never ceases to give, at least at first, a certain recognition, that we could call "learned" from the manual, of the state. But, in the end, the recognition is more verbal than real, and does not go beyond being something to get out of the way. We can say, in brief: in his reflection on worker emancipation, the State will play no role (except causing his distrust in it). Arizmendiarrieta's thought left out the State factor from the beginning; it will never be positively assumed. This is an aspect to take into account in understanding why Arizmendiarrieta opts for cooperation as the path of worker emancipation, rather than the political struggle or even unions. The idea of a church that fulfills its mission in society, outside all politics, and misunderstood by the state, will have its reflection later, in his conception of the apolitical and neutral cooperative experience.

The young priest Arizmendiarrieta has clearly "fled," for whatever reason, from politics, which is to say, from the nationalism of his student and soldier days. It will be his social determinations those that will lead him to adopt positions that are very critical of the State even before the Second World War ended.

### The absorbent State

It may seem symptomatic that Arizmendiarrieta spoke so rarely of the State; that he almost always did so, except in the first years, to criticize it in some way, is doubtlessly more than symptomatic. This attitude remains invariable over the years.

Authority, destroyed in the great crisis in which Arizmendiarrieta sees mankind immersed, is so necessary to man, who has adopted totalitarian systems, fleeing from chaos (SS, II, 3): when the authority of God is not respected, humanity falls into tyranny, and the absolute authority of God is assumed by mortal men.

As the crisis and chaos produce tyranny, this, in turn, produces the apathy in the people. This will be Arizmendiarrieta's most frequent criticism of the State, understanding this to be, generally, the Spanish State, which he repeatedly describes as absolutist. The absolutism of the state is sometimes explained as the predominance of one factor of production, by which he means capital, which reserves all rights to itself, and under whose shelter selfishness and greed flourish; other times, as the undue appropriation on the part of the State of more functions than are appropriate, using public funds always on the basis of the purposes of capitalists or praetorians, not for public services (Ib. 309). The notes on which we commented seem to be a rough draft or sketch to be able to explain himself freely; phrases are incomplete, nonetheless, the meaning does not offer great difficulty: "Capital continues enjoying of all its prerogatives... of absolutism... and the State.. is not seen thinking of correcting its absorbent, centralizing politics... which bring such large budgets that they must be extracted from those who work..." (Ib. 309-310).

"Absorbent" is the description that invariably appears each time Arizmendiarrieta refers to the State: absorbent State, absorbent effort of the State, absorbent politics... "The State, in our time, has taken many functions for itself and has a financial power that is capable, with its measures, of dispossessing whole classes for the benefit of others, altering the course of economic laws with arbitrary redistributions of goods, or disproportionate impositions. An elemental knowledge of the engines that move economic life give us an idea how little the best social policy can amount to when it is not supported by a financial policy inspired by the same motive. Today's pesetas or subsidies can apparently be the same tomorrow, but have a far lower acquisitive value, for the mere fact that the State wants it to be so. Social advances can immediately be distorted by financial measures the State takes" (CAS, 40). Arizmendiarrieta concludes that "the State needs to be controlled more than ever in our time," which is to say that social justice requires, as a necessary condition, "a free and organic political system, so that the complaints against injustices will be effective" (Ib.; texts from 1945).

On two occasions, Arizmendiarrieta criticizes State intervention into wage issues. The first time, in some incomplete notes that are difficult to date, which could be from 1950/1951&nbsp;(?) (SS, II, 309-310); the second, in 1969, concerning the wage thaw measures: "While, up until now, the price of the economic recession was paid primarily by the worker, it now turns out that in a situation of increased demand, there is also a call for sacrifice by the working masses, to prevent the system from being definitively overwhelmed. An issue that affects the large majority of the people is decided, without any prior consultation or participation of the affected, and through a Decree-Law. That just shows very clearly the purely passive role that capital assigns to labor. Neither when it is time to offer his work, nor when it is time to spend his income, does the laborer have the slightest possibility of controlling a single factor" (FC, III, 253). Thus, it is clear that we live in "an economic situation in which salaries are not free, and do not possess any initiative, and are absolutely subject to other coordinates in a system whose survival is pursued above everything else, and which subjugates everything else" (Ib.). The State's assumption of more functions than are appropriate has another effect, in the sense that "the number of its functionaries multiplies unscrupulously, functionaries who must be maintained with public funds, public funds that are not money which the authorities can have at will. An absolutist concept of authority leads to it paying preferential attention to its own judgment, and this easily leads to not serving the public well-being with the justice and accuracy it deserves" (SS, II,310).

### The paralyzing State and citizen initiative

"Despite the absorbent zeal of the state," Arizmendiarrieta says, there is much to be done in favor of the worker, fields in which the priest and Catholic Action can labor fruitfully in an apostolate with works, which is what the laborer needs (PR, I, 92): organization of mutual aid for various purposes, like for marriage or the construction of houses, military service, vacations, etc.

In Arizmendiarrieta's writings, a repeated insistence is found that citizens should unite and develop their own initiatives, without waiting for the State to intervene. State intervention generally is considered a lesser evil at best (more expense, more uniformity, etc). "It is necessary," he told Guipuzkoan businesspeople, "to continue advancing with resolve and spontaneity, without always waiting for the impositions of authority, because to do otherwise shows our lack of humanity and consideration towards our peers" (CAS, 205). The principle of subsidiarity is maintained consequently: the State should not intervene where citizens by themselves are enough to find solutions to their problems. But, for the State to not need to intervene, it is necessary for citizens, for their part, to develop the needed initiatives. "If we continue waiting for the baton of the State for everything, we're going to arrive late, at least in the sense that, every day, the spirit of class struggle penetrates deeper, and social distances grow more profound" (Ib. 171).

"In those zones of human activity in which the initiative and possibilities of individuals, or entities, or lower associations of them, can achieve their purposes, it is not necessary to wait for or desire the intervention of public entities to a greater extent and proportion than their collaboration will turn out to be truly advantageous, and not just in appearance" (PR, II, 11).

Arizmendiarrieta remembers the danger that many people believe that, with their laments, they will be excused from doing something more; or who always hope that it will be others who do the work. If each one, he says, fixed those problems they find at hand, undoubtedly we would have gotten farther. And while this does not happen, we uselessly wait around for the solution to many problems that demand a quick resolution. The State is distant, and arrives late. Responsible citizens should be pulling the cart, according to their own image, not following it.

On the other hand, Arizmendiarrieta finds it understandable that citizen initiatives do not arise: "in the current circumstances, I recognize that, unfortunately, there are many excuses for inaction. On the one hand, we have some public institutions engaged in thinking that it is enough for authority to think about or handle fixing things, as if collaboration was not needed for the most insignificant thing, and every collaboration demands a stimulus. Naturally, people fall into apathy and indolence, and it will take a lot of effort to pull them out of this lethargy, and awaken their awareness of their own responsibility, but there will be no other choice" (SS, II, 253).

With respect to the role that public institutions should play in social life, Arizmendiarrieta stands between the two extreme positions: an obsolete concept of the State, he says, works to reduce its intervention to simple functions of urban police and district attorney, trusting in the free acting of citizens for everything. The less the State does, and has to do, on its own, the better. It can be deaf and dumb to unsatisfied public or general needs, so as not be seen entangled in commitments. The opposite position sees the State replacing and supplanting the citizen in all its initiatives, meddling, with no one calling for its collaboration or presence, in all matters. Over the long term, insists Arizmendiarrieta, this way of acting puts an end to true dynamism and social vigor, because the first source of this dynamism and vigor has to be the spirit of each one of the members of society. Likewise, the management entrusted to a public entity, when it could be carried out by individuals, only complicate things further. In the long run, bureaucratic routine asphyxiates the best companies (PR, II, 13).

For Arizmendiarrieta, the function of public institutions is to provide for those needs that common citizens and other groups or associations of a private nature cannot meet satisfactorily (remember the institutional pyramid), intervening exclusively or collaborating to the extent necessary, on a case-by-case basis, in all those activities and efforts aimed at the achievement of the common good. (Ib. 13-14).

"The individual has the right to demand the support of social institutions, and likewise, of the municipality, which is the first of social institutions of the public and general type, of the state, and is the most perfect of them. The insufficiency of the individual demands, in the first place, assistance from the first public entity, which is the municipality" (Ib. 12), in problems like, for example, housing, teaching, etc. 

But, for this, citizens must first develop their dynamism, which also requires a certain level of culture. Social dynamism is conditioned by the level of each society or people (EP, I, 273). On the basis of work and culture, citizens can and must develop dynamism that leads them to their emancipation. It is only where their strength cannot do this that they can, and should, turn to State help. "Let us go to the government or higher bodies if necessary, but let us not feel that this excuses us from doing what is within our reach and, above all, let us not give up our initiative" (Ib.). "We cannot be at the mercy of what a government resolves and decides, because for as agile and omnipresent as it would like be, it is always at enough of an inevitable distance to make it necessary for other responsible people to take a role in the matter" (Ib.). 

Let us look at three cases in which citizen initiative and the intervention of public institutions can be combined: social assistance, housing, and professional teaching. We will see that Arizmendiarrieta's position is critical of the three with respect to the dominant praxis.

#### Social assistance

The realization of social objectives must be considered today as a means to give effective content to the principles of freedom and equality described by constitutions. Equality between citizens must be ensured not only before the law, but also at starting points, concerning the minimum requirements of life. Freedom must also be guaranteed by protection with respect to those minimum demands, at the risk of being reduced, as has been said many times, to the freedom to starve to death. It is obvious to Arizmendiarrieta that the State should develop a policy of social content with the aim of carrying out these two principles of equality and freedom (FC, II, 59).

A field in which private initiative and State intervention can combine is social assistance. Arizmendiarrieta considers State intervention in this field, because of the way it does it, to have had very negative consequences. "We are seeing that the sensibility that once existed in this field of assistance, in other times, in some businesses, has disappeared, with emergency formulas appearing that are of dubious validity over the long term, but of doubtless need to solve problems that cannot be postponed. This is what happens with complementary and voluntary retirement benefits that lack appropriate administrative bodies, and are left to the momentary good will of business directors. This is why we believe that we can go from serious and well-studied administration formulas to the application of interesting benefits which, in turn, can have good sources of financing" (CLP, I, 131). "We must not lose sight of the unnerving attitude produced in a community by the constant preaching of a Public Administration that presumes it always has interesting magic formulas on hand; this must imply the application of assistance and care-taking measures of a collective and very general type, leaving room for other astute people to set up benefits and complementary services to address unsatisfied needs" (Ib.).

Inspired by Arizmendiarrieta, cooperators must find social assistance formulas in which initiative and personal responsibility play a part. The need for citizen initiative will now be grounded, not just in the fact of the distance of the State, but also in regional differences. "This is why our people are referred to as having a standard of living above the average of neighboring regions, and with the possibility of comprehensive reforms of assistance and security plans at the national level, which seem to be characterized by some minimal benefits, which may affect us, because of being conceived of and regulated at the scale of national solidarity. We're going to find ourselves with the alternatives of having to accept an insufficient level of benefits for our level of development, or in need of judging for ourselves the planning and the administration of complementary benefits" (CLP, II, 103).

From his first writings, Arizmendiarrieta considers citizen initiative fundamental to the field of social assistance, believing it preferable to the indirect intervention of the State, when this was neccesary. "To bring about a true flowering of authentically social works of assistance, of living institutions, it is often enough for the State to demand the investment and documentation of certain quantities, guaranteed by the acceptance or recognition of the workers, leaving them and those companies free, and reserving to the State the inspection and guidance of the quantities. We have proven that the *Cajas* that collaborate on illness insurance have been a success when their participants have had participation in their governance and administration, and other cases could happen in other fields of social assistance, like professional teaching, housing, etc. Allowing room for initiative would easily spread a noble zeal for development in this or that person, and so we would be on the path towards a major development of these works. A minimum of other benefits would be secured for all workers, but the most diligent or interested could enjoy others; precisely because of their diligence or interest, they would deserve, and would get, greater support. To this end, the principle of mixed collaboration of enterprise and worker is extremely interesting, with a fixed proportionality and freedom of initiative for both to improve services, committing the other party to making a greater contribution, in the case of the first party making a greater sacrifice. By this formula, the boundless and light ambition of the few would be restrained, and, on the other hand, a better development and a constant perfection of works would be ensured" (CAS, 142-143).

#### Housing

In this field, Arizmendiarrieta believes that citizen initiative and municipal and State intervention or aid should know how to work together. He strongly criticizes State policy, because he does not consider it reasonable to force businesses to build apartments instead of investing in production goods, and judges as unjust "bottomless grants that the State makes to those who build houses with certain features, and which we believe cost as much as 30,000 pesetas per story" (FC, III, 51; statistics from 1967). This grant policy is unjust, because it deals with social money, which come from the taxes we all pay, and which, instead of enhancing society, directly benefits a few citizens, who are not exactly the most needy.

"It seems to us necessary for public power to help in the resolution of this problem, since otherwise, it would be unsolvable, but the chosen way does not seem right, even though it is very simple. This money that the Ministry of Housing grants should not become equity of those who acquire the residence, because in the case that they sell their property, they will profit from the social contribution received in their day. It seems more reasonable to us that this aid take the form of a long-term loan, with or without interest, such that its reimbursement could help to solve others' problems when they are in need. And fairer and more social would be for this aid to take the form of social equity in the hands of semi-public entities, at the local or provincial level, that build houses to lease to the neighbors in its area and generate profitability than could help make sure those and other funds did not lack, and had the maximum multiplier effect socially" (Ib. 51-52).

#### Professional teaching

On August 2, 1943, Arizmendiarrieta addressed a group of Mondragon businesses leaders with the following words: "Informed of the good disposition of the industrialists of Mondragon for the solution of the problem of professional teaching, and hoping that every idea or initiative leading to such objective will merit a warm reception among you, we take the liberty of addressing you in the name of Catholic Action, which must not and will not remain on the sidelines of this issue, which has such a close relationship to the ends that it pursues" (EP, I, 8). From that day, Arizmendiarrieta will find himself in constant need of reconciling private initiative and State action. The experience will not be very positive.

Arizmendiarrieta began full of optimism: "Authority," he says, "as the manager of the common good and principal promoter of public prosperity, today has to face this problem with the same decisiveness and the same breadth with which, in its day, it faced the problem of primary teaching and training" (Ib. 45). There were a time in which primary instruction was not considered a problem of the common good; its solution was then entrusted to private initiative, until it was seen that ignorance and illiteracy were a matter that affected all members of society, affecting their fate so deeply that the State, even when it meant raising public expenses considerably, no had choice but to attack the evil at its root. Primary instruction became mandatory and, so that no one could be excused, it was made free. Today, he says, no one sees public expenses earmarked for the establishment of primary teaching as debatable. It is a social service that benefits all of society.

The same should occur at once with those children or youth who are abandoned to their luck upon leaving primary school at fourteen years old (Ib. 44), with society providing them nothing that they could use to undertake an activity or a job in accordance with their skills, and not imposed by mere economic circumstances. In addition, there is the aggravation that in this society in which we live, the more social groups need outside protection, the less it provides to them, because of their social position. There exist universities, institutes and all kinds of centers maintained by funds from the public treasury, which benefit those who have the least need for outside protection. "The concession of opportunities for instruction and training in accordance with the skills and will of stakeholders is, today, an elemental postulate of good government, and is an indispensable government rule to satisfy the longing for justice and equity that sprouts in all hearts, and, on the other hand, will be a highly effective measure for stability and social co-existence" (Ib. 46).

Indeed, apart from the generous help of the people of Mondragon (Ib. 56-58), they did not lack for help from public entities, especially of the Deputation of Guipuzcoa, Caja de Ahorros Provincial, Banco Guipuzcoano, and the Official Chamber of Industry. But even with all this, "we would by lying if we said that all the requests and gestures have had results. But the lack of response to some of our requests, we believe, will be the silence of a waiting period. Ensconced in a densely populated and heavy-tax-paying area, but one which lacks in any post-school training center and has no affordable access to any other, our school provides a public teaching service, just as an official center could provide, and as we have corrected this defect, we hoped for an official assignment by the National Ministry of Education among the volume of those received by other centers of type. We believed the non-existence of another post-school teaching center in a zone in which its need is recognized, would earn us special attention. Needless to say, we were surprised to be given a concession of 2,000 pesetas" (Ib. 58-59; statistics from 1947). This grant arrived, it seems, through the Delegation of Unions. "We have all heard," replies Arizmendiarrieta, "of union dues which, just in the city of Mondragon, currently adds up to more than five hundred fifty thousand pesetas annually. Add to that what is paid in Arechavaleta and Escoriaza, which is the sponsor zone of our School" (Ib.).

Years would go by, and things would not improve much. 1951: "Can we say that the National Ministry of Education has given the slightest attention to these centers and these institutions (professional training centers)? Undoubtedly, the attention the Ministry provides to them is not at the level they deserve. In spite of their enormous multiplication and development, budget appropriations of the Ministry for these centers continue almost unchanged throughout these years. The first form of protection of the apprentices should imply broader and more decisive policy support by the Ministry for these Centers, which are, in the immense majority, private" (Ib. 236). Arizmendiarrieta accuses the "policy of statification" of teaching, which leads to apprentices quitting school and private professional training centers, as he indicates in his article, in most cases. The State prefers to build other kinds of teaching centers, especially at the intermediate level. "And now these institutes are an excuse to stop providing economic means to other centers, to subsidize existing private ones, that meet a public function. Likewise, workers and sons of workers are the ones that attend union schools and others run by other institutions" (Ib. 238).

"The Christian policy is not what is labeled that way," Arizmendiarrieta concludes bitterly, "but rather that which recognizes, and is inspired by, those other undisputed principles from the point of view of a Christian conception of administration and government" (Ib.).

In subsequent years, the critical observations multiply. In 1968, in parallel with other aspects, criticism on this topic becomes more widespread and extends to the lack of general consciousness that is observed in all of society. "By this time, there must be others, not just us, who are addressing these matters of social emancipation through professional training, both in businesses in which we work, and therefore, more or less bound to hear the demands of our needs, and in union or mutualist organizations, to which we are subscribed by payments, and for which we designate leaders, and which see fit to include among their social objectives some of these aspirations and their coverage. We think our social body has reached the age of majority, and must at least have reached an awareness of the problems that most deeply condition our future, and therefore, it is high time that in the negotiation of collective agreements, these kind of matters be an object of attention; that in the governance of social institutions, union members or mutualists give a fine-tuned expression to the sense of equity and of distributive justice in the administration of social funds; that in our organizations born to correct family powerlessness in various kinds of matters, the need to proactively address unquestionable needs in the far-off future gains resonance" (Ib. 77). What is demanded, then, is an awareness of the problem among all of society, starting with the government and unions, including businesspeople, and reaching the workers themselves, who should include this kind of demand in negotiations of collective agreements.

"We must loyally recognize that we are still far from that awareness existing, or the resulting advocacy action, and it is due to this, perhaps in no small part, that this extraordinary tool of promotion, the professional training center, is still acting with a coefficient of performance that could be notably improved, because of the limitation of affordable material resources" (Ib.).

Arizmendiarrieta's complaints go on and on. Let us limit ourselves to the concrete problem of teachers, which, more than a problem, is a culmination of them. Professional industrial training centers cannot, in the first place, have an exclusively dedicated professorship, but rather, must make constant use of assistants, because of schedules, etc., and, above all, of remuneration (Ib. 281). And this problem is difficult to solve, as long as its solution is entrusted to the Central Board of Professional Industrial Training, which is part of the Ministry of National Education. "If we adjust to what they pay upper-level teaching staff or public functionaries with skills and responsibilities analogous or superior to the teachers at the professional industrial training centers, we will have that to conclude that, practically speaking, what we intend is not possible" (Ib. 283). On the other hand, professional industrial teachers are constantly asked for by businesses. "At this time, there is no school of professional industrial training in Guipuzcoa that has the staff and degrees required by the Law" (Ib. 284).

"The only viable solution is administrative autonomy," decides Arizmendiarrieta. This is likewise imposed by regional differences. "We believe today that budgetary resources are not sufficient for current arrangements, nor is the current administrative structure adequate for agile management, which is demanded by the widely varied characteristics of the regions of Spain. To adjust to the circumstances requires a greater decentralization, with the incorporation or representation of various sectors involved in the solution to this problem, with the consequent economic contribution provided for their needs" (Ib. 309), he writes in 1962.

"In the current line of conduct of regulation and ordering, things are proceeding as if all Spain, for this purpose, had identical characteristic circumstances," accuses Arizmendiarrieta in relation to possible economic formulas to sustain professional industrial teaching. Besides the inadequacies that this policy has in itself, a fatal consequence was the loss of citizen consciousness, such that the initiatives that the State could undertake (1958) could no longer have a very enthusiastic collaboration of the living forces most directly interested. "It has been revealed that municipalities and Deputies have intervened in this field, as the one who are most sensitive to the most urgent problems of each zone or place; businesses have been taxed without incentive or attention to those who would have done something, or a lot, in this field, since three years after passing a Law, which anticipated exemptions or reductions in response to the efforts made, they have been given no satisfaction, few as they were; it is known that the payment is of a certain amount, but the exact amount is unknown and, above all, its use and destination; some Provincial Boards have been created, but with no authority or administrative autonomy, relegated to a simple bureaucratic or procedural function; we would say, in summary, that for as grave as this problem is, citizen consciousness about it has been diluted" (EP, I, 250).

The aid received never seemed to be enough. Finally, Arizmendiarrieta again turned to help from the community, from the interested parties themselves, from the businesses. Guipuzcoa, he says, has a network of professional training centers covering all of its territory, of all existing legal classifications: official centers, Church centers, union centers, free centers, company centers, and subsidiaries of cultural institutions. Almost all are deficient, both in relation to facilities and machinery, and in relation to the faculty. "Until there is an administrative decentralization, or the centers adopt the relevant measures, to assure continuity of good personnel, it will be difficult to fix this problem of personnel. Given the scope represented by both the costs of installation and maintenance of this mode of teaching, it is estimated that it will be difficult to maintain it at the level of demand without a wide economic and social participation by the whole population, which is to say, we will be interested in collaboration by businesses, workers, and various public and private institutions, so that, in this field, we not only sustain schools, but complete their action through an agile system of social credit to youth with skills to pursue training at higher levels, or that takes an interest in training them in specialized centers, whether national or foreign" (Ib. 318).

### The State and development of the cooperative movement

While, in the origin of the cooperative movement, it is necessary to recognize the decisive role of the Professional School, the criticisms of the deficiencies of the State on the topic of professional teaching could be repeated about the development of the cooperative movement. Arizmendiarrieta did so on one occasion: "Around here, the members of the Obra Sindical de Cooperación are conspicuous in their absence, to the point where if it depended on their action, at this point, in all this region, there would not be a single producer cooperative" (EP, I, 295). The criticisms of the administration, considered bureaucratic, or of "sectors of a feudal nature, that have influence on the administration" (CLP, I, 26), are not lacking, either, concerning the problems and difficulties that hamper the cooperative movement.

However, on this point, it would be good to limit ourselves to criticism of a new kind: the criticism of legislation itself.

"To affirm that the first detractor of the Cooperative is the Law itself," he wrote in 1970, "for the defective image that it provokes of the Cooperative as enterprise, and for the absence of mechanisms provided to give a future to the strength and vitality of the base, is not to make any kind of negative criticism" (FC, III, 295). For an effective and healthy advocacy of cooperatives, no less than laws, other factors count, like mental preparation and personal and collective awareness with respect to solidarity, the function of property, the common good, etc. "But the Law itself should be a pedagogue on this, and the image that it calls up in us of a cooperative business has to be clear, without error, and with well-defined commitments" (Ib. 296).

If the starting point is the principle of pluralism in forms of business organization in the field of economics, the cooperative option does not need to be identified with exclusive and excluding relationships, imposing on those who opt for it the inability to exercise other options of relationship and coexistence, as if any alliance had to be fatal or inviable for these other options. "Today, those who contemplate the economic world with a democratic and social vision, and not necessarily totalitarian or rigidly corporate, must conceive of economic entities with open options for relationship and interaction" (Ib.).

"The legislator must forsee and provide ordinary means so that cooperative entities do not live in perpetual age of minority, which is to say, they should make use of themselves, of their organization, to acquire the vigor needed to bring their commitments to a happy resolution" (Ib.). Legislation on cooperatives needs to be updated, concludes Arizmendiarrieta.

Arizmendiarrieta has been repeating this demand for years. In 1969, lamenting the grave defects of the legislative and organizational creation ("it lacks provisions to channel a cooperative movement under the impulse and risk of its initiative and vitality"), he insisted: "a new Cooperatives Law is needed" (CLP, III, 177). And in 1968, he demanded the reform of the cooperative fiscal regime: "The need for reform in this field is unavoidable if we consider the profound transformation that economic reality has suffered in these recent years, which leaves the current rules totally outdated, which, in their day, were issued for a radically different economic panorama" (FC, III, 110).

It seems that cooperatives had numerous difficulties with the current legislation right from the first moment they appeared. Cooperators' ideal of building an organization that, on the one hand, constitutes a really human community and, on the other hand, satisfies the demands of a progressive and dynamic company, "assumed more than a little reflection and study, to be able to fit such presuppositions into our cooperative legislation, which was deemed essential for the future development of the community experience. Impediments to this that the aforementioned provisions cooperatives seemed to be, at least in the common interpretation of them, overlook the way that one man, *don* José Luis del Arco, Chief of Legal Advice of the Sindical de Cooperación, took charge of the spirit that encouraged the leaders of this Cooperative Experience" (CLP, III, 173). Whenever Arizmendiarrieta narrated the history of the cooperative movement, he gratefully recalled this man, Del Arco, "who knew to how value what is fundamental and permanent" (Ib. 226), "no less sensitive and concerned for the spirit than for the letter of the Law" (Ib. 184), always "most attentive to the spirit, without contempt for the letter" (Ib. 234).

### The State and political-economic structures

Occasional criticism of Spanish economic policy is not lacking in Arizmendiarrieta's writings, like this one, arising around the water supply program of the Metropolitan Area of Madrid: "Some people clamor that the Peninsula is being desertified, and the countryside is dying of thirst. But while some howl and clamor, it looks like other are investing and progressing to maintain the capital in the foreground among analogous cities in Europe or in the world. Everything is a question of scale and interests, in which some keep saving so that others can enjoy, some working so there can be others who can walk through avenues that are more luminous and splendid every day. It is a matter of good taste and manners; of the power of each of us" (FC, IV, 236).

He uses sharper relief in his severe criticism of the Third Development Plan (1971), which he considers "more of an exercise in guessing, attentive to the political results of the increase in well-being, than an authentic effort to plan reality, which, at any rate, it only controls only a small part of, abiding by programming when it is time to solidify a timely and appropriate policy" (FC, IV, 56). Rather than a solution, Arizmendiarrieta sees the Plan as a mass of commitments that will lead to nothing. "It goes on without coming down from the limbo of pure principles, development is pursued no thanks to the modification of the guidelines of the economy, but rather in spite of them, which is to say, without debating them and without undertaking, therefore, their transformation" (Ib.). This is a plan, he says, that is short-sighted and will be short-lived, presented in beautiful lacing, but pure fiction.

Those who knew him closely testify that, contrary to what happened in his last years, Arizmendiarrieta was adopting positions that were more and more radical and revolutionary. The objective of the classless society became, for him, an obsessive idea, and he did not hide his sympathy for some revolutionary transformations of society (Cuba, etc.). On the other hand, there is no doubt that his early trust in the good disposition and capacity of various social groups or bodies (employers, unions, parties, etc.), to transform society from within, had suffered a serious break in the experience. Convinced of the need for a new order, in spite of everything, Arizmendiarrieta must have wondered about what possible subject was capable of carrying out the necessary transformation. There exist oral testimonies about all that, but not written, which is why this study prefers leave to these aspects for his biographers. There is, however, in Arizmendiarrieta's writings (1970) a critical reflection on Spanish political-economic structure, that belongs, without a doubt, to this context. In it, Arizmendiarrieta demands a deep reform of structures, not limited to immediate economic policies, since "the key to our problems lies in our economic structures and (...), therefore, it is appropriate to reform them" (FC, III, 290). How? It would first be necessary, he says, to transform the role that the State plays in the economy: "from a mere role of oversight, regulator, compensator of the deficiencies and disabilities of private initiative, to an role of being active and co-active, controller and organizer, a true leader, and not merely a subsidiary" (Ib. 290-291).

In Arizmendiarrieta's general thought, this text remains isolated. Anyway, he clearly recognizes that the State has a decisive role to play in social transformation.

Logically, it is first necessary to accept the need to transform the State itself, so that it can then fulfill its transformative function. And that is what Arizmendiarrieta does on this occasion: "But, as always, the key to the question (...) is fundamentally political and would previously suppose modifications of the current reactionary and passive character, turned over to the almighty initiative of a small oligarchy of the State" (Ib. 291).

For the construction of the new order to which Arizmendiarrieta aspires, cooperation will not be the only means, but rather one means among several. All society must commit to it—all people of good will—struggling in on many fronts and with the most diverse means, including political struggle and the transforming intervention of the State. However, this may constitute a notable deficiency in Arizmendiarrieta's thought; he himself has not reflected much on these aspects, focusing all his attention in the need to organize citizen initiative and cooperation. It should not be expected, he will insist, that the State will intervene: it is necessary to organize and act from bottom up. He considers that citizens leaving transformative functions in the hands of the state constitutes one of the greatest obstacles to the real transformation of society. So, from his personal perspective, the State will be more an obstacle and a hindrance than an instrument to count on.

## Need for a new order

Arizmendiarrieta is convinced—in his early years, to which we primarily refer in this chapter—that it is necessary to find an entirely new social order, on a new base, given that the fundamentals of both liberalism and collectivism have failed. The root of this failure, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, lies in the insufficient recognition of human dignity on the part of both ideologies. He does not see, for the moment, another possible basis for fraternity and universal solidarity than the Christian message.

### The revolution of Jesus of Nazareth

To recognize God in Jesus Christ, or believe in the God of Jesus Christ, is to recognize the incomparable dignity of mankind, as a child of God, and confess the universal fraternity of all people, children of the same Father, breaking all barriers of nation, race or class. The revolution of Jesus Christ is the revolution of fraternity, of charity, which is fundamental to and complements the practice of social justice.

With the first European war over, mankind expected long years of peace and prosperity.

Again, writes Arizmendiarrieta, mankind forgot the horrors of war, and "the dizzying progress of technology presaged for many the definitive triumph of human intelligence and reason, and so, once again, rationalism is on the rise" (SS, I, 162). Food stocks had grown to a degree such that, little later, Australians will throw millions of rams into the sea, Argentines will burn their wheat, and Brazilians their coffee. For a moment, it seemed possible to transform the world into a paradise (Ib.).

Before long, it could be seen that all efforts were useless, powerless to assure peace. Neither Wilson's fourteen points, nor the Versailles Pact could guarantee peace. Political war was followed by social war, encouraged by hatred and class enmities. "Distanced from God, rulers believed they could arrange this mad world concealed from divine law, and their efforts turned out to be children's games. The world needs a ruler and a code; and that ruler, regardless of who does not like it, is Christ, and his Law, the universal code" (SS, I, 152).

After the Second World War, continues Arizmendiarrieta, instead of the optimistic euphoria felt after the first, a profound pessimism has spread, and more than pessimism, a radical skepticism, a climate in which the only thing that is saved and thrives is personal selfishness, such that we do not want know anything about anything, except life itself and existence, the basis and foundation of the philosophical system that is all the rage these days, replacing rationalism (Ib. 163). Once more, man is abandoned to his fate, in need of rediscovering the person and work of Jesus Christ.

With respect to the person of the historical Jesus, Arizmendiarrieta observes a change of attitude among Western intellectuals and wise people since the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, which is beginning to reach the masses, incorporating itself into opinion trends, into the struggles of parties and classes. Today, he says, all social factions seek to appropriate the figure of Jesus: so it is not strange hear in our days that Jesus was a revolutionary, socialist, communist... (Ib. 9).

In this time of social struggles, "it is partly true to say that Christ was a revolutionary," recognizes Arizmendiarrieta (Ib. 9). He undoubtedly caused a radical social transformation, and began a completely new order.

In the pre-Christian, pagan world, a father could put his children to death on a whim. The pagan world did not know social assistance in the form of orphanages, asylums, or hospitals. The pagan lord could have slaves flung in his pools for the simple pleasure of seeing them drown and be fish food. Might made right (Ib. 9). For the mere fact of having put an end to this state of things, Christ can be considered a revolutionary, though certainly not for the way he acted to put an end to all that, because he did it by instilling love, mutual respect and submission to authority. "Christ, the prototype of the new man, wanted to transform the ancient world; but he did not propose do it with violence, but rather by changing it on the inside, by transforming the spirit of man. The doctrine of Christ is not dynamite that devastates, but rather, yeast that ferments and quickens." Using the words of an unnamed author—as Arizmendiarrieta very frequently did—he says: "Christ was a revolutionary the way a springtime ray of sun might be, as it makes vigorous life bloom from the deathly breast of wintry nature" (Ib.).

Others, he continues, regard Christ as a Communist, and the early Christian community as an advocate of collectivism, as the first Communist society. In the same way, they present the gospel as the fundamental and initial constitution of a new social order, presaged by the current one, of the collectivization of everything, the diametric opposite of the existing order in the Roman Empire, whose fundamental concept of private property—right to use and abuse—neither Christ nor the early community could accept.

Arizmendiarrieta again responds similarly to the previous point (revolutionary Christ): "Christ was a communist, if "communist" is understood as 'divide your bread with the hungry, and welcome the poor and homeless into your house,' or if it commands whoever has two coats to give one to a neighbor who has none... But he did not tell us to take coats from others, or that we could enter another's house and steal bread..., rather, he sanctioned the natural precept of not violating others' rights" (Ib. 10-11).

The novelty or specific contribution of Jesus consists, above all, in his concept of God the Father. This is an aspect that we do not need to pause on; instead, it will be helpful to highlight what Arizmendiarrieta directly derived from it: the dignity of man, body and soul, constituted in a child of God (Ib., 108 ff.). This is the point that transforms the existing social and political order, the basis of the new social order that, little by little, will be able to be imposed on the old world. This doctrine constitutes, in Arizmendiarrieta's opinion, "the spiritual basis for the greatest revolution history has seen" (Ib. 109). Arizmendiarrieta understands the establishment of a just social order as the establishment the kingdom of Christ. And the reign of Christ begins in the heart (Ib. 60 ff).

Today, it is urgent to remember the dignity of man, because "never has there been so much talk of freedom as there has been so far this century, and we have brought forth systems and theories that are the denial of every freedom; never have human value and dignity been spoken of as much as in these recent times and yet, never has there been so little respect or esteem than today for man, who was sacrificed with the greatest ease, whose life is looked down on as the vilest thing; never has there been so much talk as in these last years about mankind, about the common good, about class interests, about the good of mankind—so much absurdity has been justified with these pompous names—and we have reached a social situation in which never have whim and ambition, pride and arrogance, selfishness and cruelty of the strong been more the order of the day, to detriment of the true interests of the masses, of men, of mankind. That is what we have come to" (Ib. 113).

This being the situation, it is no wonder that everywhere voices rise to demand, or to promise, a new social order. However, history is the teacher of life, and we can be sure that the promised "new orders" will solve nothing, if they are not inspired by the gospel. The required new order cannot come from the ideologies that are dominant today.

Indeed, if we cast a quick glance at the history of the ideas and systems that have succeeded each other in Europe over the last hundred years, we see that "we have gone from corrosive individualism to degrading collectivism" (Ib. 113).

The prophets of freedom, proclaiming that man is just another force in the universe and that, like all things, finds his balance by being left to his fate, being left to develop his freedom and to operate freely, end up condemning the weak to death, "because they are not allowed to defend their rights by finding support in society, in forming groups, while the strong, the powerful, continue exploiting their freedom at the expense of the former" (Ib.). This is how class division is accentuated.

The liberal economic regime, in Arizmendiarrieta's judgment, has allowed the rich to increase their wealth in the same measure that the poor increase their misery. This is how mankind is divided into two opposed worlds, the world of capitalists, and the world of the poor, who are ever more poor, the victims of every kind of injustice, who, moved by the instinct of preservation, find no other way to fight in their own defense than association. Day by day, the division becomes deeper, and the struggle becomes harder, a struggle that not infrequently takes on a violent character. We, ourselves, Arizmendiarrieta remembers, have seen revolutions and revolts of this character.

As a consequence of the awakening of the oppressed human consciousness, which has found support in groups and in association for the struggle, the spirit of solidarity has developed strongly, giving way to collectivist ideologies. These consider man not as an independent whole, but rather as a part that finds its necessary essential complement in association, outside of which it has no value and does not represent anything. Man is not valued as an absolute and universal value, but rather on the basis of being a part, on the basis of the utility he can provide to the State or to production. He himself is no longer the subject of his own rights, but rather the object of the rights held for him and over him by an anonymous entity called the State, which may intrude unscrupulously into human lives, even into the consciences of citizens, and reaching the extreme of impeding man from the exercise of unrefuseable and inalienable functions and rights he has as a man ("like it does when meddles in the name of the family or of marriage") (Ib. 114). This is Arizmendiarrieta's vision.

Examining dominant ideologies and systems, "we must confess that man remains an unknown value" (Ib. 115). It is urgent, then, rediscover the dignity of man, as made manifest in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

### People of good will

The most tenacious opposition the Church has found to the fulfillment of its mission on Earth has not come from its enemies, but rather has come from Catholics themselves, who are remiss when it comes time to fulfill the social norms given by the Roman Pontiffs. More than Masonic sects, what has hurt the Church is the mute opposition there has been to the application of the principles of justice and equity. "The internal enemies are the ones that, like microbes, destroy life and bring death to the living body" (Ib. 191).

Today there is a clamor for the unity of conservative forces against the forces of revolution. "The unity of conservative forces," Arizmendiarrieta comments, "is needed, not to contain a danger, but rather to create a new world, a more just, more equitable world, and the crusade that our Roman Pontiffs propose in these times is that which must culminate, not in fiery contention, but rather in the building, in the creation, of a more just, more equitable world" (Ib.).

From the beginning, the new order to build demands the participation of everyone. For this reason, it must begin with a serious awareness of Christian obligations. Our task of universal reorganization will end up failing unless each one manages to escape that moral and spiritual lethargy, that apathy and even passivity in which we find ourselves, abandoned to an incomprehensible fatalism (Ib. 201). Arizmendiarrieta considers this attitude the consequence of collectivist ideologies and systems, that, he says, inspired by a pessimistic philosophy of mankind, which is considered incapable of intervening in life with all the weight of its personality, have judged that responsibilities should fall to a small minority, that can and should direct and control the masses. He writes in 1945, following the Christmas message of the Pope on democracy, that it is urgent to be free of those infections. "The most urgent task of this time, or in this instant, in which we find ourselves at the beginning of a new era, of a new order in which the will of a few is not going to be imposed, but rather, the will of the many is going to be respected one way or another, I repeat, the most urgent task is that of awakening the awareness of each one, and above all, the sense of responsibility of each individual" (Ib. 201).

To the objection that it is too late to preach, Arizmendiarrieta has responded in various ways, since he is confronted over and over with this objection (cf. Ib. 200, 217, 291 ff., 294 ff.). If the Church's social doctrine has had little effect to date, it has been because of the indifference of Christians, will be the most general answer. "Barbarism, impiety, brutality, and force, have triumphed for no other reason than our negligence and neglect, and have triumphed and have won and defeated only the Christianity of varnish, and of ritual. Now we have to find out if is capable of dominating and triumphing over true Christianity, Christianity of the Ten Commandments, of the social encyclicals" (Ib. 218). "The gospel has not lost efficacy because many centuries have passed since it was revealed to men. If it has not given the sought-after fruit, it is not due to its age, but rather to the malice of men who have been able to excuse themselves from complete fulfillment" (PR, I, 200).[^ch1-135]

Christianity is a religion of action, and of condemnation of the status quo, of conservatism, of accomplished facts; it is the disturbance of the satisfied. However, Christians easily forget the whole "uncomfortable" aspect of the Gospel, preferring a Christianity "that is no longer the religion of Christ" (SS, I, 158).

In order to build the desired new world, Arizmendiarrieta places an exceedingly high value on the idea, in this case truth, that must be the basis of that order. Correspondingly, he will give utmost importance to the formation of consciences, to education. Today, he says, there are no truths, there are only opinions. So, rather than men, we have reeds that sway when the wind blows, any wind of doctrine or novelty (SS, II, 252).

> Who today has a thirst for the truth, anxiety to possess it, concern to have it, who suffers because of the lack of truth?
>
> We understand that there can be suffering because of a lack of bread, because of the lack of wealth, because of the lack of health, because of the lack of love, because of the lack of certain satisfactions ... Because of the truth?
>
> Today we are passionate about sports, about politics, about art. Today, there is conversation about all this, but what is the truth or error, hardly anyone worries about that, such things are too Platonic.
>
> The saddest symptom is not professing the error itself, because if the error is professed with interest, with zeal, it would be fitting to expect something. The saddest thing is for the truth not to matter to us, to consider it a luxury item or a trifle.
>
> And so, today, we settle for opinions. It is the most man can aspire to or reach.
>
>With only opinions, nothing can be built, nothing can be raised. It is all one can do to maintain one's balance, like someone who stands on a sphere and so, has no stability. The column of truth is missing, and the stability the truth and conviction give.
>
> This is how, fatally, a civilization, an order that lacks the firm possession of the truth, is doomed to its ruin, and necessarily must disappear.
>
> This is the sign of our times (SS, I,160-161).[^ch1-136]

[^ch1-135]: Arizmendiarrieta uses this paradoxical argument on several occasions: pontifical social doctrine has not lost validity (1), the revolution of Jesus of Nazareth is possible and necessary (2), the cooperative system has not lost strength (3)... precisely because of the negative experience its failure (non-utilization, lack of attention) would mean in the history. It is the classic kind of apologetic argumentation, not without a certain sophistry, that we find formulated already in Demosthenes, *First Phillipic*: "The judgment of the past should be the source of our hopes for the future. If you had perfectly fulfilled your duty, and yet public affairs were not in better condition, it would no longer be fitting to expect a better future for them. But since, today, affairs are not in their bad state because of the strength of the things themselves, but rather because of your negligence, it is to be expected that, separated from your errors, with your minds amended, they will again take on a much more flourishing aspect."

[^ch1-136]: This insistence on the truth as the foundation of the just social order, as opposed to mere opinion, the cause of instability and decadence, that in the end, does nothing but reproduce well-known Platonic doctrines (cf. Popper, K.R., *Die offene Gesellschaft und ihre Feinde*, Francke, Bern 1957, vol. I), reminds us once more of the classical humanist training received by Arizmendiarrieta in the Seminary. The classical source of Arizmendiarrieta's thought, especially various traditional Platonic and Aristotelian ideas, is easily perceptible. Over time, his own concerns will gradually lead him away from those roots. Arizmendiarrieta polemicizes, as we have seen above and we will again find, with classical social philosophy ("by nature," writes Aristotle, Polit., I, c.2, "the city is prior to the house and to each of us, since the set is necessarily previous to the part"), or with the conception of man and of work in the society of Greek philosophy. Later, he will also abandon the Platonism of the transcendent truth that is fundamental to the social order, considering the honest search for justice a sufficient basis. However, in this first chapter concerning the starting point of Arizmendiarrieta's thought, what should stand out is his classical humanist training, on the one hand, and his traditional religious education, on the other. It is also necessary to confess that these influences become obvious first and foremost in his pastoral writing from the early years, while his social thought, which is the field where Arizmendiarrieta develops his own path, starting inapproximately 1950, and which will draw on influences that are quite different from modern philosophy, without ever ceasing to be a "classicalist" in his own way, due to the training he received. However, the recourse to illustrative examples or historical texts and Greco-Roman literature, which are very frequent in his first writings, disappears entirely in later writing.

"We lack men of convictions," he exclaims before Catholic Action youth (1950), "and convictions are a conquest that must be made, not something that is accomplished through a simple and superficial learning about the issues, about truths" (SS, II, 252). According to what can be inferred from his writings, Arizmendiarrieta gave utmost importance to the study sessions that he himself organized in the Parish for boys and girls, to "form men with consciousness of their dignity and of their responsibility, men that know what their position is in the world and their destiny in life" (Ib. 259). This is the only way for people to avoid being diluted in the masses like drops in the ocean, he will underscore (Ib. 260).

The presuppositions of a new order cannot be limited to teaching of the truth. "Doctrine that is not put into work, convictions that are not translated into acts, are something as abnormal as life that does not beat, movement that does not vibrate. We are not placed in the world to contemplate or regret, but rather to transform" (Ib. 252). The Church has long suffered the disjunction of doctrine and praxis, which is to say, as Arizmendiarrieta rather oddly puts it, it is left with Jesus Christ without his gospel. "For me, it is not the same thing to believe in Jesus Christ with relative facility—as we came to believe in his divinity—as it is to believe in the Gospel" (Ib. 265). Because to believe in the gospel is to believe in life; to believe in life is to hold to its fundamental law, which is to transform, progress, renew (Ib. 266).

And who must be the ones who, over a world that lies in ruins, will raise the new order? After having insisted on the need for God, for the Gospel, for the Church, Arizmendiarrieta surprises us a bit with his response: the builders of the new order must be all men of good will. This is not a different way of indirectly naming Christians. He leaves that quite clear by judging that, perhaps, the communists, for example, are interpreting the gospel better than not a few Christians: they carry forward a flag that symbolizes many truths that we Christians have stopped practicing. "If an angel from far-off heaven heard the echo of evangelical preaching, the echo of that magnificent Sermon on the Mount, and came to Earth and wanted to discern who are the ones that have heard Christ, perhaps he would find that, no less than in the ranks and armies of Christian uniforms, there are individuals and people who feel those things among the enemies, among those forces of violence and barbarism" (Ib. 244). Comparing the Church with the people the Old Testament, Arizmendiarrieta says that just as because the infidelity of the Jewish people, God chose another people as his instrument, He can now do the same thing: God will lose nothing because we Christians we do not want put the principles entrusted by Him into practice. There will be those who do it, "communists, or socialists, or fascists" (Ib. 272). "And it may be that, as the Gentiles of that time received the inheritance of Christ and were the ones who took the kingdom of Christ to the farthest points, so it may also be others, whom we conceive of as Gentiles and pagans, who really defend the postulates and doctrine of Christ, of the Pope, if not on all points, then at least on many. So, many of the things that we Christians should have done before anyone else, have been done before us, or in greater proportions, and with more generosity, by the so-called communists or socialists and extremists. And the strange thing today is that we find much more Christian doctrine in those parties and in those groups whom we reject as enemies of Christ and of Christianity than in many party platforms and groups that are called Catholic and labeled Catholic " (Ib. 271). It cannot be denied that true courage is needed to talk in these terms from the pulpit, in Mondragon, in September of 1944.

As for the configuration of the new order to constitute, Arizmendiarrieta expressed himself in general terms most of the time: it shall be a kingdom of justice, of peace, etc.; it must be based on the Church's social doctrine. In a text from 1944, he left us this concrete image: "The first slogan, the first objective of this new crusade that all humanity must undertake, is the redemption of the proletariat. The two pillars on which that new social order and human co-existence must rest are: an honest sufficiency of goods for all families, and the liberation of mankind, in the future, from all war" (Ib. 275).
