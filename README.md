*The Cooperative Man: Arizmendiarrieta's Thought* 


The worker cooperatives in Mondragon, Spain, have been an inspiration to generations of cooperators across the globe. The cooperatives, for their part, were inspired by a priest named José María Arizmendiarrieta (commonly shortened to Arizmendi).

People active in the worker co-op world tend to know the name Arizmendi.  For example, a network of bakeries in southern California is named for him.  There are also various websites with brief summaries of his life. 

However, people know little more than these brief summaries. There is no in-depth look at how he developed and applied his understanding of cooperativism available in English. There are at least a half-dozen such books in Spanish, but until now, none had been translated. This is a void I hope to fill. This book contains more information about Arizmendi than all other texts in English combined.

*The Cooperative Man: Arizmendiarrieta's Thought* is just what it says it is, which is to say that it is not a biography. It is a systematization of his thoughts and ideas. Arizmendi wrote voluminous papers, articles, lectures, and sermons, but he never wrote a book.  Also, while his vision for a cooperative economy was clear, often his manner of explaining it was not. He had so much to say that his ideas sometimes piled up in ways that puzzled listeners and readers.

After Arizmendi's death in 1976, the *Caja Laboral* (Mondragon's cooperative bank) collected all his papers, even grocery lists and old train tickets. Doctoral student Joxe Azurmendi spent many months studying and sorting them, and eventually wrote his thesis on them.  That thesis became the first edition of this book. The translation is of the second edition, published just as the Cold War was ending.

After recieving his doctorate, Azurmendi went on to become a professor, and to write many more books about Basque culture and society. He is an academic, and he writes for an academic audience. That is to say, the book is long, detailed, and full of extensive quotes and footnotes. 

While it is not an biography of Arizmendi, it obviously contains a considerable amount of biographical information, including unexpected elements: he was blind in one eye, Spanish was his second language, and during the Spanish Civil War, he served on both sides.

More to the point, it puts him in context: as a young war veteran and newly ordained priest, he was sent to a small, blue-collar town in the hills of the Basque Country. He spent the rest of his life there as a parish priest, suffering alongside his flock from the economic backwardness and political repression of Franco's regime. 

From the very beginning, he preached a theology that was heavily influenced by the French Personalists, especially Jacques Maritian and Emmanuel Mounier, and early British cooperators like Robert Owen and the Rochdale Pioneers. Arizmendi's early efforts focused on vocational education for the young men in town, but when that failed to expand their work opportunities, he turned to building cooperatives.  He is credited with the key innovations that have made Mondragon's co-ops the envy of the cooperative world—the *Caja Laboral*, which finances co-op development, and an integrated education system that serves all ages. 

This book will make an important contribution to both the cooperative movement and Catholic social doctrine. Nothing close exists in English, which is rather surprising, given the influence of the Mondragon cooperatives, but this indicates the need for a text that gives deeper insight into the philosophical foundations of those cooperatives.
